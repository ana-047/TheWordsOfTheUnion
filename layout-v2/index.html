                    On a cold January morning in 1790,
                    against the backdrop of a fledgling
                    nation finding its footing,
                    <b class="pres-name">George Washington</b>
                    delivered the first State of the Union address.
                    Aware of his constitutional duty and of the
                    precedent he was setting
                    for future presidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b class="pres-name">Thomas Jefferson</b>
                    abandoned the practice as “monarchical”
                    and time-consuming, sending written messages instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1913, <b class="pres-name">Woodrow Wilson</b> reinstated
                    the practice of delivering the address in person
                    and in 1947, <b class="pres-name">Harry Truman</b>
                    delivered the first address to be televised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The State of the Union has since evolved, reflecting the
                    resilience of democratic ideals shaped by
                    presidents throughout history.

            <section class="step">
                <div class="title">Similarities and Differences</div>
                <p>
                    State of the Union addresses change depending on
                    the issues facing the nation and the individual speaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, some speeches are more similar* than others.
                </p>
                <small>
                    *Similarity scores were assigned using <em>cosine similarity</em>,
                    which is an NLP metric to measure the similarity of text.
                    <!-- The darker shades represent higher similarity scores and lower scores are represented by lighter values.-->
                </small>

            <section class="step">
                <!-- <div class="title">Similarities and Differences</div>-->
                <p>
                    For example, addresses given by <b>Democrats</b> in the
                    past 30 years have a high degree of similarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps surprisingly, this similarity also largely
                    extends to speeches given by <b>Republicans</b>*.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This may be due to the tradition of speeches having a
                    formal "Presidential tone" and a refrain of common
                    themes that many presidents tend to address throughout history.
                </p>

                <p>
                Addresses delivered by a President during their tenure may be influenced by the current circumstances.
                For instance, <b class="pres-name"> President Bush's </b> 2002 address following 9/11 differed from his speech the previous year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Likewise, <b class="pres-name">President Obama's</b> inauguration address in 2009, amidst the financial crisis, exhibited some variations from his subsequent speeches.
                </p>

                <small>*With the exception of speeches given by <b class="pres-name">President Trump</b>.</small>

                <p>
                    Over the course of history, specific talking points may come and go, but
                    several general themes remain:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Borders and Territory</li>

                    <li>War, Peace, and the Military</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    "War" is a prevalent and escalating theme in presidential discussions,
                    encompassing topics from international conflicts to peace declarations
                    and post-war reconstruction.
                </p>

             <p>
                 Similarly, the "economy", a vital aspect of national well-being, is a consistent theme
                 in presidential addresses, covering updates, achievements, and proposed policies.

                    For example, following the 2008 financial crisis, <b class="pres-name">President Obama</b> aimed to inspire hope by adopting a positive tone when addressing the economy.
                    He underscored initiatives to stabilize the economy, generate employment, and foster economic recovery.

                    Or in the early 2000s, <b class="pres-name">President Bush</b> often  mentioned "war" with a negative sentiment, associated with the 9/11 terror attacks or invasion of Iraq,
                    which led to a prolonged and costly conflict with significant human and financial cost.

                    <li>The resonance of past themes in contemporary addresses serves as a stark reminder
