                    On a cold January morning in 1790,
                    against the backdrop of a fledgling
                    nation finding its footing,
                    <b class="pres-name">George Washington</b>
                    delivered the first State of the Union address.
                    Aware of his constitutional duty and of the
                    precedent he was setting
                    for future presidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b class="pres-name">Thomas Jefferson</b>
                    abandoned the practice as “monarchical”
                    and time-consuming, sending written messages instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1913, <b class="pres-name">Woodrow Wilson</b> reinstated
                    the practice of delivering the address in person
                    and in 1947, <b class="pres-name">Harry Truman</b>
                    delivered the first address to be televised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The State of the Union has since evolved, reflecting the
                    resilience of democratic ideals shaped by
                    presidents throughout history.

                <div class="title">Similarities and Differences</div>
                <p>
                    State of the Union addresses change depending on
                    the issues facing the nation and the individual speaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, some speeches are more similar* than others.
                </p>
                <small>
                    *Similarity scores were assigned using <em>cosine similarity</em>,
                    which is an NLP metric to measure the similarity of text.

                <p>
                    For example, addresses given by <b>Democrats</b> in the
                    past 30 years have a high degree of similarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps surprisingly, this similarity also largely
                    extends to speeches given by <b>Republicans</b>*.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This may be due to the tradition of speeches having a
                    formal "Presidential tone" and a refrain of common
                    themes that many presidents tend to address throughout history.
