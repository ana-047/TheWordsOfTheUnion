<!--                <div class="title page-title">A Time Honored Tradition</div>-->
                <p>
                    On a cold January morning in 1790,
                    against the backdrop of a fledgling nation finding its footing,
                    <b class="pres-name">George Washington</b>
                    personally delivered the first State of the Union address, aware of his constitutional duty and of the precedent he was setting
                    for future presidents.
                </p>


                <p>
                    <b class="pres-name">Thomas Jefferson</b> abandoned the practice as “monarchical” and time-consuming, sending written messages instead.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 1913,    <b class="pres-name"> Woodrow Wilson</b> reinstated the practice of delivering the address in person
                    and in 1947, <b class="pres-name">Harry Truman's</b> was the first address to be televised.
                </p>
                <p>
                The SOTU has since evolved, reflecting the resilience of democratic ideals shaped by leaders throughout history.

                    The average SOTU speech length is 8K words, ~53 minutes long if delivered at a rate of 150 words per minute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Democrats tend to go 12% longer than their Republican counterparts.

                <p>
                    George Washington holds the record for brevity, using just under 1.1K words in 1790 while Jimmy Carter holds the
                    record for the longest address - 33.6K words in 1981.

            <section class="step">
                <div class="title">Similarities and Differences</div>
                <p>
                    Historically, State of the Union addresses have varied depending on the context of the time, the issues facing the nation, and the individual speaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, some speeches are more similar than others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, a look at addresses given in the past 30 years suggests that there is a high degree of similarity between speeches given by Democratic Presidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps surprisingly, this similarity also largely extends to speeches given by Republicans (with the exception of speeches given by President Trump).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is perhaps due to the traditional "Presidential tone" of a speech being generally positive and the themes remaining relatively constant.
                </p>
                <small>
                    Similarity scores were assigned using cosine similarity, which is an NLP metric to measure the similarity of text. The darker shades represent higher similarity scores and lower scores are represented by lighter values.

                    Over the course of history, specific talking points may come and go, but
                    several general themes remain:

                <p>
                    Though the themes remain consistent, the way in which Presidents talk about them changes.

                <small>

                <p>

                <p>
                    In recent years, the focus of State of the Union addresses has shifted from prominent mentions of Mexico, a neighbor, and Great Britain, a longstanding ally,
                </p>
                <p>
                    to an emphasis on American adversaries and countries with which the United States has engaged in conflicts.

                <p>
                    Over the past decade, China, Afghanistan, Iran, Russia, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea have prominently featured in these addresses, marking a notable shift in the geopolitical landscape addressed by U.S. presidents.
