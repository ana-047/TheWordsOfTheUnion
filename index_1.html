                <p>Over the centuries, the speech has evolved into a crucial annual event, providing Presidents with a platform to address the nation, communicate their policy priorities, and fulfill the constitutional obligation to update Congress on the state of affairs.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">

                        <p>In recent years, the focus of historical State of the Union addresses has shifted from prominent mentions of Mexico, a neighbor,
                            and Great Britain, a longstanding ally, to an emphasis on American adversaries and countries with which the United States has engaged in conflicts.
                            Over the past decade, China, Afghanistan, Iran, Russia, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea have prominently featured in these addresses,
                            marking a notable shift in the geopolitical landscape addressed by U.S. presidents.</p>
                        <p>A complex interplay of political, diplomatic, and rhetorical considerations may be the reason why
                            adversaries have been mentioned more than allies. Since one of the objectives of the SOTU is addressing imminent challenges, adversarial relations, conflicts, or international tensions are likely to be significant challenges that presidents feel compelled to address.
                            In some cases, addressing adversaries could be a priority, either to emphasize the need for diplomatic resolutions, to highlight threats,  rally public support for particular actions or demonstrate leadership and  resolve.

                        addresses are very different from his predecessors...</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Historically, SOTU addresses have varied  depending on
                        the context of the time, the issues facing the nation, and the individual speaking.
                        However, more often than not, there are recurring themes such as the economy, war,
                        foreign policy, trade, healthcare, social security, immigration among others.
                        Presidents also tend to address current events, challenges, and their policy priorities.<br><br>
                        A look at addresses given in the past 30 years in the heatmap below suggests
                        that there is a high degree of
                        similarity between speeches given by the Democratic Presidents. Meanwhile, with the exception of President Trump,
                        there are subtle but not stark differences between Republicans and Democrats as the tone is generally positive and the themes remain constant. Similarity scores were assigned
                        using cosine similarity, which is an NLP metric to measure the similarity of text.
                        The darker shades of blue represent higher similarity scores which lower scores are represented by lighter values.
                        <br><br>
                        President Trump's addresses stand out as being different not only from addresses given by Presidents - Clinton, Obama and Biden
                        but also different from President Bush, a Republican President. The scores highlight not only his eccentric style but also his varying policy priorities.
                        Another interesting observation is the difference in addresses given by President Bush in 2001 after taking office
                        and 2002 in the aftermath of 9/11, which changed the world forever. Also, President Obama's 2009 address after taking office in the middle of the
                        financial crisis is slightly different from his subsequent addresses.
