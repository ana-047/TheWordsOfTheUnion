Overview:

The "Words of the Union" aims to visualize and analyze the historical State of the Union (SOTU) addresses. These annual speeches by the U.S. President to Congress outline national goals, priorities, and address various issues. In the context of today's media landscape, characterized by data overload and misinformation, the project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to dissect language, persuasive techniques, and sentiment in SOTU speeches. The goal is to understand the evolution of political discourse over time, identify common themes, analyze points of divergence among presidents, and gain insights into the relationship between political rhetoric and global events.
