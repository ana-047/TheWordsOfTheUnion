      "{'year': 2023, 'name': 'Joseph R Biden', 'party': 'Democratic', 'text': \" Thank you. You can smile. It's okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Please. Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman—good to see you guys up there—[applause]—Members of Congress. and by the way, Chief Justice, I may need a court order. She gets to go to the game tomorrow—next week. I have to stay home. [Laughter] We've got to work something out here. Members of the Cabinet, leaders of our military, Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court, and to you, my fellow Americans- You know, I start tonight by congratulating the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. Speaker, I don't want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you. [Laughter] And I want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats, the first African American minority leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries. He won in spite of the fact I campaigned for him. [Laughter] Congratulations to the longest serving leader in the history of the United States Senate, Mitch McConnell. Where are you, Mitch? And congratulations to Chuck Schumer, another—you know, another term as Senate minority [majority; White House correction] leader. You know, I think you—only this time you have a slightly bigger majority, Mr. Leader. And you're the majority leader. About that much bigger? [Laughter] Yes. Well, I tell you what, I want to give special recognition to someone who I think is going to be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of the House of Representatives- Nancy Pelosi. Folks, the story of America is a story of progress and resilience, of always moving forward, of never, ever giving up. It's a story unique among all nations. We're the only country that has emerged from every crisis we've ever entered stronger than we got into it. Look, folks, that's what we're doing again. Two years ago, the economy was reeling. I stand here tonight, after we've created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs—more jobs created in 2 years than any President has created in 4 years—because of you all, because of the American people. Two years ago—[applause]. And 2 years ago, COVID had shut down—our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much. And today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And 2 years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. And today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. As we gather here tonight, we're writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America—and they do, believe it or not—I say I can define it in one word, and I mean this- possibilities. We don't think anything is beyond our capacity. Everything is a possibility. You know, we're often told that Democrats and Republicans can't work together. But over the past 2 years, we've proved the cynics and naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats went alone. But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together. Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe. You came together to pass one-in-a-generation—once-in-a-generation infrastructure law building bridges connecting our Nation and our people. We came together to pass one the most significant law ever helping victims exposed to toxic burn pits. And, in fact—[applause]. It's important. And, in fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming President, from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act to the Electoral Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love. And to my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there's no reason we can't work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well. I think—folks, you all are as informed as I am, but I think the people sent us a clear message- Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict gets us nowhere. That's always been my vision of our country, and I know it's many of yours- to restore the soul of this Nation; to rebuild the backbone of America, America's middle class; and to unite the country. We've been sent here to finish the job, in my view. For decades, the middle class has been hollowed out in more than—and not in one administration, but for a long time. Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be. And along the way, something else we lost- pride, our sense of self-worth. I ran for President to fundamentally change things. To make sure our economy works for everyone so we can all feel that pride in what we do. To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up, and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. I know a lot of you always kid me for always quoting my dad. But my dad used to say,  Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  Because he really would say this.  It's about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it. Well, folks, so let's look at the results. We're not finished yet, by any stretch of the imagination. But unemployment rate is at 3.4 percent, a 50-year low. And near record—and near record unemployment—near record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers. We've already created, with your help, 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years. And where is it written—where is it written that America can't lead the world in manufacturing? And I don't know where that's written. For too many decades, we imported projects and exported jobs. Now, thanks to what you've all done, we're exporting American products and creating American jobs. Folks, inflation—inflation has been a global problem because the pandemic disrupted our supply chains, and Putin's unfair and brutal war in Ukraine disrupted energy supplies as well as food supplies, blocking all that grain in Ukraine. But we're better positioned than any country on Earth right now. But we have more to do. But here at home, inflation is coming down. Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 from their peak. Food inflation is coming down, not fast enough, but coming down. Inflation has fallen every month for the last 6 months, while take-home pay has gone up. Additionally, over the last 2 years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start new businesses. Ten million. And by the way, every time—every time someone starts a small business, it's an act of hope. And, Madam Vice President, I want to thank you for leading that effort to ensure that small businesses have access to capital and the historic laws we enacted that are going to just come into being. Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibilities. Semiconductors—small computer chips the size of a fingerprint that power everything from cellphones to automobiles and so much more—these chips were invented in America. Let's get that straight- They were invented in America. And we used to make 40 percent of the world's chips. In the last several decades, we lost our edge. We're down to only producing 10 percent. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories shut down overseas. Today's automobiles need 3,000 chips—each of those automobiles—but American automobiles [automakers; White House correction] couldn't make enough cars because there weren't enough chips. Car prices went up. People got laid off. So did everything from refrigerators to cell phones. We can never let that happen again. That's why—that's why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. Folks, I know I've been criticized for saying this, but I'm not changing my view. We're going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America—the supply chain begins in America. And we've already created—[applause]. We've already created 800,000 new manufacturing jobs without this law, before the law kicks in. With this new law, we're going to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country. And I mean all across the country, throughout—not just the coast, but through the middle of the country as well. That's going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investment in American manufacturing over the next few years. Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres, literally a  field of dreams.  It's going to create 10,000 jobs, that one investment; 7,000 construction jobs; 3,000 jobs in those factories once they're finished. They call them factors. Jobs paying an average of $130,000 a year, and many do not require a college degree. And jobs—because we worked together, these jobs where people don't have to leave home to search for opportunity. And it's just getting started. Think about the new homes, the small businesses, the big—the medium-sized businesses. So much more that's going to be needed to support those 3,000 permanent jobs and the factories that are going to be built. Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they'll tell you what this means for their communities. We're seeing these  fields of dreams  transform the Heartland. But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world. And, folks, as you all know, we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure. We've sunk to 13th in the world. The United States of America—13th in the world in infrastructure, modern infrastructure. But now we're coming back because we came together and passed the bipartisan infrastructure law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. And, folks, already, we've funded over 20,000 projects, including major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland, projects that are going to put thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, our bridges, our railroads, our tunnels, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed internet all across America- urban, rural, Tribal. And, folks, we're just getting started. We're just getting started. And I mean this sincerely- I want to thank my Republican friends who voted for the law. And my Republican friends who voted against it as well—but I'm still—I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well, but don't worry. [Laughter] I promised I'd be a President for all Americans. We'll fund these projects. And I'll see you at the groundbreaking. Look, this law—this law will further unite all of America. Projects like Brent Spence Bridge in Kentucky over the Ohio River, built 60 years ago, badly in need of repairs. One of the Nation's most congested freight routes, carrying $2 billion worth of freight every single day across the Ohio River. And, folks, we've been talking about fixing it for decades, but we're really finally going to get it done. I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans in—from both States—to deliver a commitment of $1.6 billion for this project. And while I was there, I met a young woman named Saria, who's here tonight. I don't know where Saria is. Is she up in the box? I don't know. Saria, how are you? Well, Saria—for 30 years—for 30 years—I learned—she told me she'd been a proud member of the Ironworkers Local 44, known as—known as the  Cowboys in the Sky —the folks who built Cincinnati's skyline. Saria said she can't wait to be 10 stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. God bless her. [Laughter] That's pride. And that's what we're also building- We're building back pride. Look, we're also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes in America, 400,000 schools and childcare centers so every child in America—every child in American—can drink the water, instead of having permanent damage to their brain. Look, we're making sure—[applause]—we're making sure that every community—every community in America—has access to affordable, high-speed internet. No parent should have to drive by a McDonald's parking lot to help their—do their homework online with their kids, which many—thousands were doing across the country. And when we do these projects—and, again, I get criticized about this, but I make no excuses for it—we're going to buy American. We're going to buy American. Folks—[applause]—and it's totally—it's totally—consistent with international trade rules. Buy American has been the law since 1933. But for too long, past administrations—Democrat and Republican—have fought to get around it. Not anymore. Tonight I'm announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in Federal infrastructure projects to be made in America. Made in America. I mean it. Lumber, glass, drywall, fiber-optic cable. And on my watch, American roads, bridges, and American highways are going to be made with American products as well. Folks, my economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. So many of you listening tonight, I know you feel it. So many of you felt like you've just simply been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind and treated like they're invisible. Maybe that's you, watching from home. You remember the jobs that went away. You remember them, don't you? The folks at home remember them. You wonder whether the path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without having to move away. Well, that's why—I get that. That's why we're building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of choices we made in the last several years. You know, this is, in my view, a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives at home. For example, too many of you lay in bed at night, like my dad did, staring at the ceiling, wondering what in God's name happens if your spouse gets cancer or your child gets deadly ill or if something happens to you. What are you going—are you going to have the money to pay for those medical bills? Are you going to have to sell the house or try to get a second mortgage on it? I get it. I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we're taking on powerful interests to bring health care costs down so you can sleep better at night with more security. You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any nation in the world. Let me say it again- We pay more for prescription drugs than any major nation on Earth. For example, 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes. Many of you in this chamber do and in the audience. But every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can literally stay alive. Insulin has been around for over 100 years. The guy who invented it didn't even patent it because he wanted it to be available for everyone. It costs the drug companies roughly $10 a vial to make that insulin. Package it and all, you may get up to $13. But Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars, $4- to $500 a month, making record profits. Not anymore. Not anymore. Audience members. Not anymore! Not anymore! Not anymore! The President. So many things that we did are only now coming to fruition. We said we were doing this, and we said we'd pass the law to do it, but people didn't know because the law didn't take effect until January 1 of this year. We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare. But people are just finding out. I'm sure you're getting the same calls I'm getting. Look, there are millions of other Americans who do not—are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with type 1 diabetes who need these insulin—need this insulin to stay alive. Let's finish the job this time. Let's cap the cost of insulin for everybody at $35. Folks—and Big Pharma is still going to do very well, I promise you all. [Laughter] I promise you they're going to do very well. This law also—this law also caps—and it won't even go into effect until 2025. It costs [caps; White House correction] out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum of $2,000 a year. You don't have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter how much your drug costs are. Because you know why? You all know it. Many of you, like many of my family, have cancer. You know the drugs can range from $10-, $11-, $14-, $15,000 for the cancer drugs. And if drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies are going to have to pay Medicare back the difference. And we're finally—we're finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down—bringing down prescription drug costs doesn't just save seniors money, it cuts the Federal deficit by billions of dollars—[applause]—by hundreds of billions of dollars because these prescription drugs are drugs purchased by Medicare to make—keep their commitment to the seniors. Well, guess what? Instead of paying 4- or 500 bucks a month, you're paying 15. That's a lot of savings for the Federal Government. And by the way, why wouldn't we want that? Now, some Members here are threatening—and I know it's not an official party position, so I'm not going to exaggerate—but threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. As my coach—that's okay. That's fair. As my football coach used to say,  Lots of luck in your senior year.  [Laughter] Make no mistake, if you try anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it. And look, I'm pleased to say that more Americans health—have health insurance now than ever in history. A record 16 million people are enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. And thanks to the law I signed last year, saving—millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums. And by the way, that law was written—and the benefit expires in 2025. So my plea to some of you, at least in this audience- Let's finish the job and make these savings permanent. Expand coverage on Medicaid. Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever in climate change—ever. Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, leading the world to a clean energy future. I visited the devastating aftermath of record floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires from Arizona to New Mexico to all the way up to the Canadian border. More timber has been burned that I've observed from helicopters than the entire State of Missouri. And we don't have global warming? Not a problem. In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we're rebuilding for the long term. New electric grids that are able to weather major storms and not—prevent those fire—forest fires. Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood. Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities often left behind. We're going to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers. And we're helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits to purchase electric vehicles and efficient—and efficient appliances—energy-efficient appliances. Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our land. Let's face reality. The climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or a blue State. It's an existential threat. We have an obligation not to ourselves, but to our children and our grandchildren to confront it. I'm proud of how the—how America, at last, is stepping up to the challenge. We're still going to need oil and gas for a while, but guess what—[applause]—no, we do—but there's so much more to do. We've got to finish the job. And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Just begin. Look, I'm a capitalist. I'm a capitalist. But pay your fair share. I think a lot of you at home—a lot of you at home—agree with me and many people that you know- The tax system is not fair. It is not fair. Look, the idea that in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America, the Fortune 500, made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in Federal taxes? Zero. Audience members. Boo! The President. Folks, it's simply not fair. But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. God love them. Fifteen percent. That's less than a nurse pays. And let me be crystal clear. I said at the very beginning- Under my plans, as long as I'm President, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in taxes. Nobody. Not one penny. But let's finish the job. There's more to do. We have to reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for the billionaire minimum tax. You know, there's a thousand billionaires in America—it's up from about 600 at the beginning of my term—but no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a schoolteacher or a firefighter. No, I mean it. Think about it. I mean, look, I know you all aren't enthusiastic about that, but think about it. Think about it. Have you noticed? Big Oil just reported its profits. Record profits. Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis. I think it's outrageous. Why? They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production. And when I talked to a couple of them, they say,  We were afraid you were going to shut down all the oil wells and all the oil refineries anyway, so why should we invest in them?  I said,  We're going to need oil for at least another decade, and that's going to exceed —[laughter]—and beyond that. We're going to need it. Production. If they had, in fact, invested in the production to keep gas prices down—instead they used the record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders. Corporations ought to do the right thing. That's why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They'll still make considerable profit. Let's finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes. Instead of cutting the number of audits for wealthy taxpayers, I just signed a law to reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. That's being fiscally responsible. In the last 2 years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history. Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up 4 years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no President added more to the national debt in any 4 years than my predecessor. Nearly 25 percent of the entire national debt that took over 200 years to accumulate was added by just one administration alone, the last one. They're the facts. Check it out. Check it out. How did Congress respond to that debt? They did the right thing. They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis. They paid the American bill to prevent an economic disaster to the country. So tonight I'm asking the Congress to follow suit. Let's commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned. So my—many of—some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage—I get it—unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what those plans are. Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset. I'm not saying it's a majority—— Audience members. Boo! The President. Let me give you—— Audience members. No! The President. Anybody who doubts it, contact my office. I'll give you a copy. I'll give you a copy of the proposal. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Liar! The President. That means Congress doesn't vote—— Well, I'm glad to see—no, I tell you, I enjoy conversion. [Laughter] You know, it means if Congress doesn't keep the programs the way they are, they'd go away. Other Republicans say—I'm not saying it's a majority of you. I don't even think it's a significant—— Audience member. [Inaudible]—don't say—— The President. ——but it's being proposed by individuals. Audience member. But you don't say who. The President. I'm not—politely not naming them, but it's being proposed by some of you. Audience members. [Inaudible] Rep. Greene. Liar, liar! The President. Look, folks, the idea is that we're not going to be—we're not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we don't respond. Folks—[applause]—so, folks, as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the books now, right? They're not to be touched? [Applause] All right. All right. We've got unanimity! Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors. Americans have to pay into them from the very first paycheck they've started. So tonight let's all agree—and we apparently are—let's stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare. Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned it. And if anyone tries to cut Social Security—which apparently no one is going to do—[laughter]—and if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I'll stop them. I'll veto it. And look, I'm not going to allow them to take away—be taken away. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. But apparently, it's not going to be a problem. [Laughter] Next month, when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to lay down their plan as well. I really mean it. Let's sit down together and discuss our mutual plans together. Let's do that. I can tell you, the plan I'm going to show you is going to cut the deficit by another $2 trillion. And it won't cut a single bit of Medicare or Social Security. In fact, we're going to extend the Medicare Trust Fund at least two decades, because that's going to be the next argument- how do we make—keep it solvent. Right? Well, I will not raise taxes on anyone making under 400 grand. But we'll pay for it the way we talked about tonight- by making sure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. Look—look, look, here's the deal. They aren't just taking advantage of the Tax Code, they're taking advantage of you, the American consumer. Here's my message to all of you out there- I have your back. We're already preventing Americans who are [from; White House correction] receiving surprise medical bills, stopping 1 billion dollar surprise bills [1 million surprise bills; White House correction] per month so far. We're protecting seniors' life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs that are not needed. Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get a hearing aid over the counter without a prescription. Look, capitalism without competition is not capitalism, it's extortion; it's exploitation. Last year, I cracked down, with the help of many of you, on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for every good coming into the country. I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90 percent, helping American farmers, businessmen, and consumers. Let's finish the job. Pass the bipartisan legislation to strengthen and—to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage. My administration is also taking on junk fees, those hidden surcharges too many companies use to make you pay more. For example, we're making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront, refund your money if your flight is canceled or delayed. We've reduced exorbitant bank overdrafts by saving consumers more than $1 billion a year. We're cutting credit card late fees by 75 percent, from $30 to $8. Look, junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most other folks in homes like the one I grew up in, like many of you did. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month. They make it harder for you to pay your bills or afford that family trip. I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it. Not anymore. We've written a bill to stop it all. It's called the Junk Fee Prevention Act. We're going to ban surprise resort fees that hotels charge on your bill. Those fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren't even resorts. [Laughter] We—the idea that cable, internet, and cell phone companies can charge you $200 or more if you decide to switch to another provider. Give me a break. We can stop service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all the fees upfront. And we'll prohibit airlines from charging $50 roundtrip for a family just to be able to sit together. Baggage fees are bad enough. Airlines can't treat your child like a piece of baggage. Americans are tired of being—we're tired of being played for suckers. So pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off. For too long, workers have been getting stiffed, but not anymore. We're going to be—we're beginning to restore the dignity of work. For example, I should have known this, but I didn't until 2 years ago- Thirty million workers have to sign noncompete agreements for the jobs they take. Thirty million. So a cashier at a burger place can't walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more. Audience members. Boo! The President. It just changed. Well, they just changed it because we exposed it. That was part of the deal, guys. Look it up. But not anymore. We're banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they're worth. And I must tell you, this is bound to get a response from my friends on my left, but the right. I'm so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing. Pass the PRO Act! Because businesses have a right—workers have a right to form a union. And let's guarantee all workers have a living wage. Let's make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, affordable childcare. That's going to enable millions of more people to go and stay at work. And let's restore the full child tax credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half to the lowest level in history. And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity, we increase economic growth. So let's finish the job and get more families access to affordable, quality housing. Let's get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. Let's give more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones. Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the homecare services they need and support the workers who are doing God's work. These plans are fully paid for, and we can afford to do them. Restoring the dignity of work means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class. You know, when we made public education—12 years of it—universal in the last century, we made the best educated, best paid—we became the best education, best paid nation in the world. But the rest of the world has caught up. It's caught up. Jill, my wife, who teaches full-time, has an expression. I hope I get it right, kid. [Laughter]  Any nation that outeducates is going to outcompete us.  Any nation that outeducates is going to outcompete us. Folks, we all know 12 years of education is not enough to win the economic competition of the 21st century. If we want to have the best educated workforce, let's finish the job by providing access to preschool for 3 and 4 years old. Studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50-percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background they came from. Let's give public school teachers a raise. We're making progress by reducing student debt, increasing Pell grants for working and middle class families. Let's finish the job and connect students to career opportunities starting in high school, provide access to 2 years of community college, the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a 4-year degree. Let's offer every American a path to a good career, whether they go to college or not. And, folks—folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis, when schools were closed and we were shutting down everything, let's recognize how far we came in the fight against the pandemic itself. While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people and the ingenuity of medicine, we've broken the COVID grip on us. COVID deaths are down by 90 percent. We've saved millions of lives and opened up our country—we opened our country back up. And soon, we'll end the public health emergency. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. But—that's called a public health emergency. But we'll remember the toll and pain that's never going to go away. More than a million Americans lost their lives to COVID. A million. Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table constantly reminding you that she used to sit there. Remembering them, we remain vigilant. We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments. So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe. And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, we're also—got to double down prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat. Before I came to office, you remember, during that campaign, the big issue was about inspector generals who would protect taxpayers' dollars, who were sidelined. They were fired. Many people said,  We don't need them.  And fraud became rampant. Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then—since then, we've recovered billions of taxpayers' dollars. Now let's triple the antifraud strike force going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars—billions of dollars—from the American people. And the data shows that for every dollar we put into fighting fraud, the taxpayer will get back at least 10 times as much. It matters. It matters. Look, COVID left its scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. We have an obligation to make sure all people are safe. Public safety depends on public trust, as all of us know. But too often, that trust is violated. Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols—welcome—[applause]—who had to bury Tyre last week. As many of you personally know, there's no words to describe the heartache or grief of losing a child. But imagine—imagine—if you lost that child at the hands of the law. Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter came home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving a car. Most of us in here have never had to have  the talk — the talk —that Brown and Black parents have had to have with their children. Beau, Hunter, Ashley—my children—I never had to have the talk with them. I never had to tell them-  If a police officer pulls you over, turn your interior lights on right away. Don't reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel. Imagine having to worry like that every single time your kid got in a car. Here's what Tyre's mother shared with me when I spoke to her, when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out. With the faith of God, she said her son was, quote,  a beautiful soul  and  something good will come of this.  Imagine how much courage and character that takes. It's up to us, to all of us. We all want the same thing- neighborhoods free of violence, law enforcement who earns the community's trust. Just as every cop, when they pin on that badge in the morning, has a right to be able to go home at night, so does everybody else out there. Our children have a right to come home safely. Equal protection under the law is a covenant we have with each other in America. We know police officers put their lives on the line every single night and day. And we know we ask them, in many cases, to do too much—to be counselors, social workers, psychologists—responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and so much more. In one sense, we ask much too much of them. I know most cops and their families are good, decent, honorable people—the vast majority. That they risk—[applause]. And they risk their lives every time they put that shield on. But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often. We have to do better. Give law enforcement the real training they need. Hold them to higher standards. Help them to succeed in keeping them safe. We also need more first responders and professionals to address the growing mental health, substance abuse challenges. More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime. More community intervention programs. More investments in housing, education, and job training. All this can help prevent violence in the first place. And when police officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable. With the support—[applause]. With the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an Executive order for all Federal officers, banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act. Let's commit ourselves to make the words of Tyler's [Tyre's; White House correction] mom true- Something good must come from this. Something good. And all of us—all of us—[applause]. Folks, it's difficult, but it's simple- All of us in the Chamber—in this Chamber, we need to rise to this moment. We can't turn away. Let's do what we know in our hearts that we need to do. Let's come together to finish the job on police reform. Do something. Do something. That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde—I met with every one of them— Do something about gun violence.  Thank God—thank God—we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades. That includes things like—that the majority of responsible gun owners already support- enhanced background checks for 18 to 21 years old, red-flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others. But we know our work is not done. Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero. Brandon put his college dreams on hold—to be at his mom's side—his mom's side when she was dying from cancer. And Brandon now works at the dance studio started by his grandparents. And 2 weeks ago, during the Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio door close, and he saw a man standing there pointing a semiautomatic pistol at him. He thought he was going to die, but he thought about the people inside. In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semiautomatic pistol away from the gunman who had already killed 11 people in another dance studio. Eleven. He saved lives. It's time we do the same. Ban assault weapons now! Ban them now! Once and for all. I led the fight to do that in 1994. And in 10 years that ban was law, mass shootings went down. After we let it expire in a Republican administration, mass shootings tripled. Let's finish the job and ban these assault weapons. And let's also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months. We've launched a new border plan last month. Unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97 percent as a consequence of that. But American border problems won't be fixed until Congress acts. If we don't pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border—and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers. Here in  the people's house,  it's our duty to protect all the people's rights and freedoms. Congress must restore the right and—— Audience member. Secure the border! Audience member. [Inaudible]—border! Audience members. [Inaudible] The President. Congress must restore the right that was taken away in Roe v. Wade and protect Roe v. Wade. Give every woman the constitutional right. The Vice President and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety. But already, more than a dozen States are enforcing extreme abortion bans. Make no mistake about it- If Congress passes a national ban, I will veto it. But let's also pass—let's also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity. Our strength—our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let's remember- The world is watching. I spoke from this Chamber 1 year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal attack against Ukraine, a murderous assault, evoking images of death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II. Putin's invasion has been a test for the ages—a test for America, a test for the world. Would we stand for the most basic of principles? Would we stand for sovereignty? Would we stand for the right of people to live free of tyranny? Would we stand for the defense of democracy? For such defense matters to us because it keeps peace and prevents open season on would-be aggressors that threatens our prosperity. One year later, we know the answer. Yes, we would. And we did. We did. And together, we did what America always does at our best. We led. We united NATO. We built a global coalition. We stood against Putin's aggression. We stood with the Ukrainian people. And tonight we're once again joined by Ukrainians' Ambassador to the United States. She represents not her—just her nation, but the courage of her people. Ambassador is—our Ambassador is here, united in our—we're united in our support of your country. Will you stand so we can all take a look at you? Thank you. Because we're going to stand with you as long as it takes. Our Nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere. Before I came to office, the story was about how the People's Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world. Not anymore. We made clear and I made clear in my personal conversations, which have been many, with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict. But I will make no apologies that we're investing and—to make America stronger. Investing in American innovation and industries that will define the future that China intends to be dominating. Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect advanced technologies so they will not be used against us. Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and determine—deter aggression. Today, we're in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world. Anyone else in the world. And I'm committed—I'm committed—to work with China where we can advance American interests and benefit the world. But make no mistake about it- As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did. Look, let's be clear- Winning the competition should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world. But in the past 2 years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker. Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger. Name me a world leader who'd change places with Xi Jinping. Name me one. Name me one. America is rallying the world to meet those challenges, from climate to global health to food insecurity to terrorism to territorial aggression. Allies are stepping up, spending more, and doing more. Look, the bridges we're forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning how wrong they are. It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against America. Never. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. Well—— Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. When I came to office, most assured that bipartisanship—assumed—was impossible. But I never believed it. That's why a year ago, I offered a unity agenda to the Nation as I stood here. We made real progress together. We passed the law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction. We passed the gun safety law, making historic investments in mental health. We launched the ARPA-H drive for breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes, and so much more. We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named after the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year. And I understand something about those burn pits. But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together. Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire. He wrote Jill, my wife, a letter—and me as well—about his courageous daughter Courtney. A contagious laugh. His sister's best friend—her sister's best friend. He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans and many of you in the audience. Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually death from a fentanyl overdose. She was just 20 years old. Describing the last 8 years without her, Doug said,  There is no worse pain.  Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end the stigma and change laws. He told us he wants to  start a journey towards American recovery. Doug, we're with you. Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year. Big—— Audience members. [Inaudible]—the border. Audience members. The border! The President. Big—you've got it. Audience member. [Inaudible]—China! Representative W. Andrew Ogles IV. It's your fault! Audience members. Boo! The President. So let's launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production and the sale and trafficking. With more drug detection machines, inspection cargo, stop pills and powder at the border. Working with couriers, like FedEx, to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking. Second, let's do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at their schools. We must finally hold social media companies accountable for experimenting they're doing—running [on; White House correction] children for profit. And it's time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data that companies collect on all of us. Third, let's do more to keep this Nation's one fully sacred obligation- to equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home. Job training, job placement for veterans and their spouses as they come to—return to civilian life. Helping veterans to afford their rent, because no one should be homeless in America, especially someone who served the country. Denis McDonough is here, of the VA. We had our first real discussion when I asked him to take the job. And I'm glad he did. We were losing up to 25 veterans a day on suicide. Now we're losing 17 a day to the silent scourge of suicide. Seventeen veterans a day are committing suicide, more than all the people being killed in the wars. Folks, VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screening, proven programs that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they're going through, get them the help they need. We've got to do more. And fourth, last year, Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that I was able to start with, and President Obama asked me to lead our administration on this issue. Our goal is to cut the cancer death rates at least by 50 percent in the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases, provide more support for patients and their families. It's personal to so many of us, so many of us in this audience. Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama. They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I got married in New York City. Kindred spirits. He wrote us a letter about his little daughter Ava. And I saw her just before I came over. She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease—cancer. After 26 blood transfusions, 11 rounds of radiation, 8 rounds of chemo, 1 kidney removed, given a 5 percent survival rate. He wrote how, in the darkest moments, he thought,  If she goes, I can't stay.  Many of you have been through that as well. Jilly and I understand that, like so many of you. And he read Jill's book describing our family's cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where we could with Beau. For them, that glimmer of joy was the half-smile of their baby girl. It meant everything to them. They never gave up hope, and little Ava never gave up hope. She turns 4 next month. They just found out Ava is beating the odds, is on her way to being cured of cancer. And she's watching from the White House tonight, if she's not asleep already. For the lives we can save—[applause]. For the lives we can save and the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and prove that we can still do big things. Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, he undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It's been a huge success. He thought big. He thought large. He moved! I believe we can do the same thing with cancer. Let's end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all. Folks, there's one reason why we've been able to do all of these things- our democracy itself. It's the most fundamental thing of all. With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is. Over the last few years, our democracy has been threatened and attacked, put at risk—put to the test in this very room on January the 6th. And then, just a few months ago, an unhinged  big lie  assailant unleashed a political violence at the home of the then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, using the very same language the insurrectionists used as they stalked these halls and chanted on January 6. Here tonight, in this Chamber, is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and as strong and as resilient as they get- my friend, Paul Pelosi. Paul, stand up. But such a heinous act should have never happened. We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. We have to protect the right to vote, not suppress the—that fundamental right. Honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We have to uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy. And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor. Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It's an American issue. Every generation of Americans have faced a moment where they have been called to protect our democracy, defend it, stand up for it. And this is our moment. My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point, one of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the direction we now take is going to decide the course of this Nation for decades to come. We're not bystanders of history. We're not powerless before the forces that confront us. It's within our power of  We the People.  We're facing the test of our time. We have to be the nation we've always been at our best- optimistic, hopeful, forward-looking; a nation that embraces light over dark, hope over fear, unity over division, stability over chaos. We have to see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We're good people. The only nation in the world built on an idea—the only one. Other nations are defined by geography, ethnicity, but we're the only nation based on an idea that all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities. So I have come to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report on the state of the Union. And here is my report- Because the soul of this Nation is strong, because the backbone of this Nation is strong, because the people of this Nation are strong, the state of the Union is strong. I'm not new to this place. I stand here tonight having served as long as about any one of you who have ever served here. [Laughter] But I've never been more optimistic about our future, about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we do it together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.\"}\n"

       "FreqDist({'Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives In meeting you again I feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public affairs The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce The progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary In conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of florins toward which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland As well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success The Secretary of the Treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information Since your last sessions I have received communications by which it appears that the district of Kentucky at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that State in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct member of the Union in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added For this sanction application is now made I shall cause the papers on this very transaction to be laid before you The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment to the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow citizens of Kentucky can not fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the northwest side of the Ohio These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the Western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the Government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers and I have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were deemed sufficient The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary of War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expense with which it will be attended The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their markets I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to both of these great objects Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offer us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it distressful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons You will consider in your wisdom whether improvements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether an uniform process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal courts be not desirable through all the States The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and sea men has called for the appointment of consuls in foreign countries It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence The consular convention too with His Most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the national authority to his consuls established here Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect The establishment of the militia of a mint of standards of weights and measures of the post office and post roads are subjects which I presume you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favorite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt funded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself The appropriation you have made of the Western land explains your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded that the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with the other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be to every public interest as well as the more satisfactory to our constituents Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives In pursuing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultation will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the cooperation which an undiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established Government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence': 1, 'Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives In vain may we expect peace with the Indians on our frontiers so long as a lawless set of unprincipled wretches can violate the rights of hospitality or infringe the most solemn treaties without receiving the punishment they so justly merit I meet you upon the present occasion with the feelings which are naturally inspired by a strong impression of the prosperous situations of our common country and by a persuasion equally strong that the labors of the session which has just commenced will under the guidance of a spirit no less prudent than patriotic issue in measures conducive to the stability and increase of national prosperity Numerous as are the providential blessings which demand our grateful acknowledgments the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the industry of the husbandman is too important to escape recollection Your own observations in your respective situations will have satisfied you of the progressive state of agriculture manufactures commerce and navigation In tracing their causes you will have remarked with particular pleasure the happy effects of that revival of confidence public as well as private to which the Constitution and laws of the United States have so eminently contributed and you will have observed with no less interest new and decisive proofs of the increasing reputation and credit of the nation But you nevertheless can not fail to derive satisfaction from the confirmation of these circumstances which will be disclosed in the several official communications that will be made to you in the course of your deliberations The rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States which completed the sum allowed to be subscribed in a single day is among the striking and pleasing evidences which present themselves not only of confidence in the Government but of resource in the community In the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the execution of the different objects which were specially provided for by the laws and resolutions of the last session Among the most important of these is the defense and security of the western frontiers To accomplish it on the most humane principles was a primary wish Accordingly at the same time the treaties have been provisionally concluded and other proper means used to attach the wavering and to confirm in their friendship the well disposed tribes of Indians effectual measures have been adopted to make those of a hostile description sensible that a pacification was desired upon terms of moderation and justice Those measures having proved unsuccessful it became necessary to convince the refractory of the power of the United States to punish their depredations Offensive operations have therefore been directed to be conducted however as consistently as possible with the dictates of humanity Some of these have been crowned with full success and others are yet depending The expeditions which have been completed were carried on under the authority and at the expense of the United States by the militia of Kentucky whose enterprise intrepidity and good conduct are entitled of peculiar commendation Overtures of peace are still continued to the deluded tribes and considerable numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced all further opposition removed from their former situations and placed themselves under the immediate protection of the United States It is sincerely to be desired that all need of coercion in future may cease and that an intimate intercourse may succeed calculated to advance the happiness of the Indians and to attach them firmly to the United States In order to this it seems necessary That they should experience the benefits of an impartial dispensation of justice That the mode of alienating their lands the main source of discontent and war should be so defined and regulated as to obviate imposition and as far as may be practicable controversy concerning the reality and extent of the alienations which are made That commerce with them should be promoted under regulations tending to secure an equitable deportment toward them and that such rational experiments should be made for imparting to them the blessings of civilization as may from time to time suit their condition That the Executive of the United States should be enabled to employ the means to which the Indians have been long accustomed for uniting their immediate interests with the preservation of peace And that efficacious provision should be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all those who by violating their rights shall infringe the treaties and endanger the peace of the Union A system corresponding with the mild principles of religion and philanthropy toward an unenlightened race of men whose happiness materially depends on the conduct of the United States would be as honorable to the national character as conformable to the dictates of sound policy The powers specially vested in me by the act laying certain duties on distilled spirits which respect the subdivisions of the districts into surveys the appointment of officers and the assignment of compensations have likewise been carried into effect In a manner in which both materials and experience were wanting to guide the calculation it will be readily conceived that there must have been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compensation as would conciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limits prescribed by the law It is hoped that the circumspection which has been used will be found in the result to have secured the last of the two objects but it is probable that with a view to the first in some instances a revision of the provision will be found advisable The impressions with which this law has been received by the community have been upon the whole such as were to be expected among enlightened and well disposed citizens from the propriety and necessity of the measure The novelty however of the tax in a considerable part of the United States and a misconception of some of its provisions have given occasion in particular places to some degree of discontent but it is satisfactory to know that this disposition yields to proper explanations and more just apprehensions of the true nature of the law and I entertain a full confidence that it will in all give way to motives which arise out of a just sense of duty and a virtuous regard to the public welfare If there are any circumstances in the law which consistently with its main design may be so varied as to remove any well intentioned objections that may happen to exist it will consist with a wise moderation to make the proper variations It is desirable on all occasions to unite with a steady and firm adherence to constitutional and necessary acts of Government the fullest evidence of a disposition as far as may be practicable to consult the wishes of every part of the community and to lay the foundations of the public administration in the affections of the people Pursuant to the authority contained in the several acts on that subject a district of miles square for the permanent seat of the Government of the United States has been fixed and announced by proclamation which district will comprehend lands on both sides of the river Potomac and the towns of Alexandria and Georgetown A city has also been laid out agreeably to a plan which will be placed before Congress and as there is a prospect favored by the rate of sales which have already taken place of ample funds for carrying on the necessary public buildings there is every expectation of their due progress The completion of the census of the inhabitants for which provision was made by law has been duly notified excepting one instance in which the return has been informal and another in which it has been omitted or miscarried and the returns of the officers who were charged with this duty which will be laid before you will give you the pleasing assurance that the present population of the United States borders on persons It is proper also to inform you that a further loan of florins has been completed in Holland the terms of which are similar to those of the one last announced except as to a small reduction of charges Another on like terms for florins had been set on foot under circumstances that assured an immediate completion Gentlemen of the Senate Two treaties which have been provisionally concluded with the Cherokees and Six Nations of Indians will be laid before you for your consideration and ratification Gentlemen of the House of Representatives In entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust you must anticipate with pleasure that many of the difficulties necessarily incident to the first arrangements of a new government for an extensive country have been happily surmounted by the zealous and judicious exertions of your predecessors in cooperation with the other branch of the Legislature The important objects which remain to be accomplished will I am persuaded be conducted upon principles equally comprehensive and equally well calculated of the advancement of the general weal The time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by the act making provision for the debt of the United States having expired statements from the proper department will as soon as possible apprise you of the exact result Enough however is known already to afford an assurance that the views of that act have been substantially fulfilled The subscription in the domestic debt of the United States has embraced by far the greatest proportion of that debt affording at the same time proof of the general satisfaction of the public creditors with the system which has been proposed to their acceptance and of the spirit of accommodation to the convenience of the Government with which they are actuated The subscriptions in the debts of the respective States as far as the provisions of the law have permitted may be said to be yet more general The part of the debt of the United States which remains unsubscribed will naturally engage your further deliberations It is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you that the revenues which have been established promise to be adequate to their objects and may be permitted if no unforeseen exigency occurs to supersede for the present the necessity of any new burthens upon our constituents An object which will claim your early attention is a provision for the current service of the ensuing year together with such ascertained demands upon the Treasury as require to be immediately discharged and such casualties as may have arisen in the execution of the public business for which no specific appropriation may have yet been made of all which a proper estimate will be laid before you Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives I shall content myself with a general reference to former communications for several objects upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto postponed any definitive resolution Their importance will recall them to your attention and I trust that the progress already made in the most arduous arrangements of the Government will afford you leisure to resume them to advantage These are however some of them of which I can not forbear a more particular mention These are the militia the post office and post roads the mint weights and measures a provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States The first is certainly an object of primary importance whether viewed in reference to the national security to the satisfaction of the community or to the preservation of order In connection with this the establishment of competent magazines and arsenals and the fortification of such places as are peculiarly important and vulnerable naturally present themselves to consideration The safety of the United States under divine protection ought to rest on the basis of systematic and solid arrangements exposed as little as possible to the hazards of fortuitous circumstances The importance of the post office and post roads on a plan sufficiently liberal and comprehensive as they respect the expedition safety and facility of communication is increased by their instrumentality in diffusing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the Government which while it contributes to the security of the people serves also to guard them against the effects of misrepresentation and misconception The establishment of additional cross posts especially to some of the important points in the Western and Northern parts of the Union can not fail to be of material utility The disorders in the existing currency and especially the scarcity of small change a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes strongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution already entered into concerning the establishment of a mint Measures have been taken pursuant to that resolution for procuring some of the most necessary artists together with the requisite apparatus An uniformity in the weights and measures of the country is among the important objects submitted to you by the Constitution and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal must be no less honorable to the public councils than conducive to the public convenience A provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is particularly urged among other reasons by the important considerations that they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the public debt that if timely and judiciously applied they may save the necessity of burthening our citizens with new taxes for the extinguishment of the principal and that being free to discharge the principal but in a limited proportion no opportunity ought to be lost for availing the public of its right': 1, 'Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives It is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our Northwestern frontier have terminated You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavors toward effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier to stop the further effusion of blood to arrest the progress of expense to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes in making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable or if not attainable to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed The issue of some of them indeed is still depending but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace It will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality toward the families of the deceased It must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamaugas inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighboring settlements It was hoped that the treaty of Holston made with the Cherokee Nation in July would have prevented a repetition of such depredations but the event has not answered this hope The Chickamaugas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you Hitherto defensive precautions only have been strictly enjoined and observed It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed A delay of operations besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing toward a pacific termination of the war has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostility I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory To enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighborhood If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States These impediments have lessened and are lessening in local extent and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters I judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders and Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system A representation from the judges of the Supreme Court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced In the course of the execution of the laws considerations arise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy As connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses against the Constitution and laws of the Union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary It would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them I particularly recommend to your consideration the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishing just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them and in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session In execution of the authority given by the Legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint Others have been employed at home Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will I doubt not be resumed and completed It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the post office operate in experiment against the transmission of news papers to distant parts of the country Should this upon due inquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy The adoption of a constitution for the State of Kentucky has been notified to me The Legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for florins one at Antwerp at the annual interest of with an allowance of in lieu of all charges in the other at Amsterdam at the annual interest of with an allowance of in one case and of in the other in lieu of all charges The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the Government No measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States pursuant to the eleventh section of the act by which it is incorporated In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not will engage your early attention Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you Various temporary laws will expire during the present session Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit particular notice The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment to that Constitution of Government upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils': 1, 'Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives Since the commencement of the term for which I have been again called into office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to my fellow citizens at large the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimony of public approbation While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been honored by my country on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for that retirement from which no private consideration should ever have torn me But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives and that the people and the authorities derived from them would support exertions having nothing personal for their object I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the Executive power and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of nations depends to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United States have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our disposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by belligerent nations It seemed therefore to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to any of the parties and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal state of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our situation Under these impressions the proclamation which will be laid before you was issued In this posture of affairs both new and delicate I resolved to adopt general rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privileges of the United States These were reduced into a system which will be communicated to you Although I have not thought of myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to be brought into our ports I have not refused to cause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our territory or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the United States It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct improve or enforce this plan of procedure and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States to many cases which though dependent on principles already recognized demand some further provisions Where individuals shall within the United States array themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war or enter upon military expeditions or enterprises within the jurisdiction of the United States or usurp and exercise judicial authority within the United States or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked or are inadequate these offenses can not receive too early and close an attention and require prompt and decisive remedies Whatsoever those remedies may be they will be well administered by the judiciary who possess a long established course of investigation effectual process and officers in the habit of executing it In like manner as several of the courts have doubted under particular circumstances their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace and even of a citizen of the United States although seized under a false color of being hostile property and have denied their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory it would seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points But if the Executive is to be the resort in either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts when for his own information he shall request it I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us The United States ought not to indulge a persuasion that contrary to the order of human events they will forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history of every other nation abounds There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld if not absolutely lost by the reputation of weakness If we desire to avoid insult we must be able to repel it if we desire to secure peace one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity it must be known that we are at all times ready for war The documents which will be presented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazines and arsenals and yet an addition even to these supplies can not with prudence be neglected as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger Nor can such arrangements with such objects be exposed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of republican government They are incapable of abuse in the hands of the militia who ought to possess a pride in being the depository of the force of the Republic and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the United States But it is an inquiry which can not be too solemnly pursued whether the act more effectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the United States has organized them so as to produce their full effect whether your own experience in the several States has not detected some imperfections in the scheme and whether a material feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely interesting The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the knowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent communication When we contemplate the war on our frontiers it may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the Indians north of the Ohio The instructions given to the commissioners evince a moderation and equity proceeding from a sincere love of peace and a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests and dignity of the United States The attempt however of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated the troops have marched to act offensively Although the proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation it is doubtful how far the advance of the season before good faith justified active movements may retard them during the remainder of the year From the papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject you will determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be compensated by succors of militia or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees The former have been relieved with corn and with clothing and offensive measures against them prohibited during the recess of Congress To satisfy the complaints of the latter prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed upon them But the papers which will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which we stand in regard to both those tribes and it is with Congress to pronounce what shall be done After they shall have provided for the present emergency it will merit their most serious labors to render tranquillity with the savages permanent by creating ties of interest Next to a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace the establishment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their attachment But it ought to be conducted without fraud without extortion with constant and plentiful supplies with a ready market for the commodities of the Indians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive in exchange Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be allured by the hope of profit but it will be enough for the United States to be reimbursed only Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet in the hands of the Executive Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The commissioners charged with the settlement of accounts between the United States and individual States concluded their important function within the time limited by law and the balances struck in their report which will be laid before Congress have been placed on the books of the Treasury On the first day of June last an installment of florins became payable on the loans of the United States in Holland This was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan at an interest of for the term of ten years and the expenses of this operation were a commission of The first installment of the loan of from the Bank of the United States has been paid as was directed by law For the second it is necessary that provision be made No pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt On none can delay be more injurious or an economy of time more valuable The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it but it is not expected to prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested Some auxiliary provisions will therefore it is presumed be requisite and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of our citizens who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a future accumulation of burthens But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportation of public prints There is no resource so firm for the Government of the United States as the affections of the people guided by an enlightened policy and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithful representation of public proceedings diffused without restraint throughout the United States An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores made during the recess will be presented to Congress Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide range to your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common country Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task Without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the Government may be hazarded without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentiment its dignity may be lost But as the legislative proceedings of the United States will never I trust be reproached for the want of temper or of candor so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation': 1, 'Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives When we call to mind the gracious indulgence of Heaven by which the American people became a nation when we survey the general prosperity of our country and look forward to the riches power and happiness to which it seems destined with the deepest regret do I announce to you that during your recess some of the citizens of the United States have been found capable of insurrection It is due however to the character of our Government and to its stability which can not be shaken by the enemies of order freely to unfold the course of this event During the session of the year it was expedient to exercise the legislative power granted by the Constitution of the United States to lay and collect excises In a majority of the States scarcely an objection was heard to this mode of taxation In some indeed alarms were at first conceived until they were banished by reason and patriotism In the four western counties of Pennsylvania a prejudice fostered and imbittered by the artifice of men who labored for an ascendency over the will of others by the guidance of their passions produced symptoms of riot and violence It is well known that Congress did not hesitate to examine the complaints which were presented and to relieve them as far as justice dictated or general convenience would permit But the impression which this moderation made on the discontented did not correspond with what it deserved The arts of delusion were no longer confined to the efforts of designing individuals The very forbearance to press prosecutions was misinterpreted into a fear of urging the execution of the laws and associations of men began to denounce threats against the officers employed From a belief that by a more formal concert their operation might be defeated certain self created societies assumed the tone of condemnation Hence while the greater part of Pennsylvania itself were conforming themselves to the acts of excise a few counties were resolved to frustrate them It is now perceived that every expectation from the tenderness which had been hitherto pursued was unavailing and that further delay could only create an opinion of impotency or irresolution in the Government Legal process was therefore delivered to the marshal against the rioters and delinquent distillers No sooner was he understood to be engaged in this duty than the vengeance of armed men was aimed at his person and the person and property of the inspector of the revenue They fired upon the marshal arrested him and detained him for some time as a prisoner He was obliged by the jeopardy of his life to renounce the service of other process on the west side of the Allegheny Mountain and a deputation was afterwards sent to him to demand a surrender of that which he had served A numerous body repeatedly attacked the house of the inspector seized his papers of office and finally destroyed by fire his buildings and whatsoever they contained Both of these officers from a just regard to their safety fled to the seat of Government it being avowed that the motives to such outrages were to compel the resignation of the inspector to withstand by force of arms the authority of the United States and thereby to extort a repeal of the laws of excise and an alteration in the conduct of Government Upon testimony of these facts an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States notified to me that in the counties of Washington and Allegheny in Pennsylvania laws of the United States were opposed and the execution thereof obstructed by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshal of that district On this call momentous in the extreme I sought and weighted what might best subdue the crisis On the one hand the judiciary was pronounced to be stripped of its capacity to enforce the laws crimes which reached the very existence of social order were perpetrated without control the friends of Government were insulted abused and overawed into silence or an apparent acquiescence and to yield to the treasonable fury of so small a portion of the United States would be to violate the fundamental principle of our Constitution which enjoins that the will of the majority shall prevail On the other to array citizen against citizen to publish the dishonor of such excesses to encounter the expense and other embarrassments of so distant an expedition were steps too delicate too closely interwoven with many affecting considerations to be lightly adopted I postponed therefore the summoning of the militia immediately into the field but I required them to be held in readiness that if my anxious endeavors to reclaim the deluded and to convince the malignant of their danger should be fruitless military force might be prepared to act before the season should be too far advanced My proclamation of the th of August last was accordingly issued and accompanied by the appointment of commissioners who were charged to repair to the scene of insurrection They were authorized to confer with any bodies of men or individuals They were instructed to be candid and explicit in stating the sensations which had been excited in the Executive and his earnest wish to avoid a resort to coercion to represent however that without submission coercion must be the resort but to invite them at the same time to return to the demeanor of faithful citizens by such accommodations as lay within the sphere of Executive power Pardon too was tendered to them by the Government of the United States and that of Pennsylvania upon no other condition than a satisfactory assurance of obedience to the laws Although the report of the commissioners marks their firmness and abilities and must unite all virtuous men by shewing that the means of conciliation have been exhausted all of those who had committed or abetted the tumults did not subscribe the mild form which was proposed as the atonement and the indications of a peaceable temper were neither sufficiently general nor conclusive to recommend or warrant the further suspension of the march of the militia Thus the painful alternative could not be discarded I ordered the militia to march after once more admonishing the insurgents in my proclamation of the th of September last It was a task too difficult to ascertain with precision the lowest degree of force competent to the quelling of the insurrection From a respect indeed to economy and the ease of my fellow citizens belonging to the militia it would have gratified me to accomplish such an estimate My very reluctance to ascribe too much importance to the opposition had its extent been accurately seen would have been a decided inducement to the smallest efficient numbers In this uncertainty therefore I put into motion fifteen thousand men as being an army which according to all human calculation would be prompt and adequate in every view and might perhaps by rendering resistance desperate prevent the effusion of blood Quotas had been assigned to the States of New Jersey Pennsylvania Maryland and Virginia the governor of Pennsylvania having declared on this occasion an opinion which justified a requisition to the other States As commander in chief of the militia when called into the actual service of the United States I have visited the places of general rendezvous to obtain more exact information and to direct a plan for ulterior movements Had there been room for a persuasion that the laws were secure from obstruction that the civil magistrate was able to bring to justice such of the most culpable as have not embraced the proffered terms of amnesty and may be deemed fit objects of example that the friends to peace and good government were not in need of that aid and countenance which they ought always to receive and I trust ever will receive against the vicious and turbulent I should have caught with avidity the opportunity of restoring the militia to their families and homes But succeeding intelligence has tended to manifest the necessity of what has been done it being now confessed by those who were not inclined to exaggerate the ill conduct of the insurgents that their malevolence was not pointed merely to a particular law but that a spirit inimical to all order has actuated many of the offenders If the state of things had afforded reason for the continuance of my presence with the army it would not have been withholden But every appearance assuring such an issue as will redound to the reputation and strength of the United States I have judged it most proper to resume my duties at the seat of Government leaving the chief command with the governor of Virginia Still however as it is probable that in a commotion like the present whatsoever may be the pretense the purposes of mischief and revenge may not be laid aside the stationing of a small force for a certain period in the four western counties of Pennsylvania will be indispensable whether we contemplate the situation of those who are connected with the execution of the laws or of others who may have exposed themselves by an honorable attachment to them Thirty days from the commencement of this session being the legal limitation of the employment of the militia Congress can not be too early occupied with this subject Among the discussions which may arise from this aspect of our affairs and from the documents which will be submitted to Congress it will not escape their observation that not only the inspector of the revenue but other officers of the United States in Pennsylvania have from their fidelity in the discharge of their functions sustained material injuries to their property The obligation and policy of indemnifying them are strong and obvious It may also merit attention whether policy will not enlarge this provision to the retribution of other citizens who though not under the ties of office may have suffered damage by their generous exertions for upholding the Constitution and the laws The amount even if all the injured were included would not be great and on future emergencies the Government would be amply repaid by the influence of an example that he who incurs a loss in its defense shall find a recompense in its liberality While there is cause to lament that occurrences of this nature should have disgraced the name or interrupted the tranquillity of any part of our community or should have diverted to a new application any portion of the public resources there are not wanting real and substantial consolations for the misfortune It has demonstrated that our prosperity rests on solid foundations by furnishing an additional proof that my fellow citizens understand the true principles of government and liberty that they feel their inseparable union that notwithstanding all the devices which have been used to sway them from their interest and duty they are not as ready to maintain the authority of the laws against licentious invasions as they were to defend their rights against usurpation It has been a spectacle displaying to the highest advantage of republican government to behold the most and the least wealthy of our citizens standing in the same ranks as private soldiers preeminently distinguished by being the army of the Constitution undeterred by a march of miles over rugged mountains by approach of an inclement season or by any other discouragement Nor ought I to omit to acknowledge the efficacious and patriotic cooperation which I have experienced from the chief magistrates of the States to which my requisitions have been addressed To every description of citizens let praise be given but let them persevere in their affectionate vigilance over that precious depository of American happiness the Constitution of the United States Let them cherish it too for the sake of those who from every clime are daily seeking a dwelling in our land And when in the calm moments of reflection they shall have retraced the origin and progress of the insurrection let them determine whether it has not been fomented by combinations of men who careless of consequences and disregarding the unerring truth that those who rouse can not always appease a civil convulsion have disseminated from an ignorance or perversion of facts suspicions jealousies and accusations of the whole Government Having thus fulfilled the engagement which I took when I entered into office to the best of my ability to preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States on you gentlemen and the people by whom you are deputed I rely for support In the arrangement to which the possibility of a similar contingency will naturally draw your attention it ought not to be forgotten that the militia laws have exhibited such striking defects as could not have been supplied by the zeal of our citizens Besides the extraordinary expense and waste which are not the least of the defects every appeal to those laws is attended with a doubt on its success The devising and establishing of a well regulated militia would be a genuine source of legislative honor and a perfect title to public gratitude I therefore entertain a hope that the present session will not pass without carrying to its full energy the power of organizing arming and disciplining the militia and thus providing in the language of the Constitution for calling them forth to execute the laws of the Union suppress insurrections and repel invasions As auxiliary to the state of our defense to which Congress can never too frequently recur they will not omit to inquire whether the fortifications which have been already licensed by law be commensurate with our exigencies The intelligence from the army under the command of General Wayne is a happy presage to our military operations against the hostile Indians north of the Ohio From the advices which have been forwarded the advance which he has made must have damped the ardor of the savages and weakened their obstinacy in waging war against the United States And yet even at this late hour when our power to punish them can not be questioned we shall not be unwilling to cement a lasting peace upon terms of candor equity and good neighborhood Toward none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friendship been spared The Creeks in particular are covered from encroachment by the imposition of the General Government and that of Georgia From a desire also to remove the discontents of the Six Nations a settlement mediated at Presque Isle on Lake Erie has been suspended and an agent is now endeavoring to rectify any misconception into which they may have fallen But I can not refrain from again pressing upon your deliberations the plan which I recommended at the last session for the improvement of harmony with all the Indians within our limits by the fixing and conducting of trading houses upon the principles then expressed Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The time which has elapsed since the commencement of our fiscal measures has developed our pecuniary resources so as to open the way for a definite plan for the redemption of the public debt It is believed that the result is such as to encourage Congress to consummate this work without delay Nothing can more promote the permanent welfare of the nation and nothing would be more grateful to our constituents Indeed whatsoever is unfinished of our system of public credit can not be benefited by procrastination and as far as may be practicable we ought to place that credit on grounds which can not be disturbed and to prevent that progressive accumulation of debt which must ultimately endanger all governments An estimate of the necessary appropriations including the expenditures into which we have been driven by the insurrection will be submitted to Congress Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The Mint of the United States has entered upon the coinage of the precious metals and considerable sums of defective coins and bullion have been lodged with the Director by individuals There is a pleasing prospect that the institution will at no remote day realize the expectation which was originally formed of its utility In subsequent communications certain circumstances of our intercourse with foreign nations will be transmitted to Congress However it may not be unseasonable to announce that my policy in our foreign transactions has been to cultivate peace with all the world to observe the treaties with pure and absolute faith to check every deviation from the line of impartiality to explain what may have been misapprehended and correct what may have been injurious to any nation and having thus acquired the right to lose no time in acquiring the ability to insist upon justice being done to ourselves Let us unite therefore in imploring the Supreme Ruler of Nations to spread his holy protection over these United States to turn the machinations of the wicked to the confirming of our Constitution to enable us at all times to root out internal sedition and put invasion to flight to perpetuate to our country that prosperity which his goodness has already conferred and to verify the anticipations of this Government being a safeguard of human rights': 1, 'Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives I trust I do not deceive myself when I indulge the persuasion that I have never met you at any period when more than at the present the situation of our public affairs has afforded just cause for mutual congratulation and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all Good for the numerous and extraordinary blessings we enjoy The termination of the long expensive and distressing war in which we have been engaged with certain Indians northwest of the Ohio is placed in the option of the United States by a treaty which the commander of our army has concluded provisionally with the hostile tribes in that region In the adjustment of the terms the satisfaction of the Indians was deemed worthy no less of the policy than of the liberality of the United States as the necessary basis of durable tranquillity The object it is believed has been fully attained The articles agreed upon will immediately be laid before the Senate for their consideration The Creek and Cherokee Indians who alone of the Southern tribes had annoyed our frontiers have lately confirmed their preexisting treaties with us and were giving evidence of a sincere disposition to carry them into effect by the surrender of the prisoners and property they had taken But we have to lament that the fair prospect in this quarter has been once more clouded by wanton murders which some citizens of Georgia are represented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks which have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and danger which will be productive of further expense and may occasion more effusion of blood Measures are pursuing to prevent or mitigate the usual consequences of such outrages and with the hope of their succeeding at least to avert general hostility A letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our treaty made with his father the late Emperor and consequently the continuance of peace with that power With peculiar satisfaction I add that information has been received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers importing that the terms of the treaty with the Dey and Regency of that country had been adjusted in such a manner as to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace and the restoration of our unfortunate fellow citizens from a grievous captivity The latest advices from our envoy at the Court of Madrid give moreover the pleasing information that he had assurances of a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of his negotiation While the event depending upon unadjusted particulars can not be regarded as ascertained it is agreeable to cherish the expectation of an issue which securing amicably very essential interests of the United States will at the same time lay the foundation of lasting harmony with a power whose friendship we have uniformly and sincerely desired to cultivate Though not before officially disclosed to the House of Representatives you gentlemen are all apprised that a treaty of amity commerce and navigation has been negotiated with Great Britain and that the Senate have advised and consented to its ratification upon a condition which excepts part of one article Agreeably thereto and to the best judgment I was able to form of the public interest after full and mature deliberation I have added my sanction The result on the part of His Britannic Majesty is unknown When received the subject will without delay be placed before Congress This interesting summary of our affairs with regard to the foreign powers between whom and the United States controversies have subsisted and with regard also to those of our Indian neighbors with whom we have been in a state of enmity or misunderstanding opens a wide field for consoling and gratifying reflections If by prudence and moderation on every side the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity on terms compatible with our national rights and honor shall be the happy result how firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for accelerating maturing and establishing the prosperity of our country Contemplating the internal situation as well as the external relations of the United States we discover equal cause for contentment and satisfaction While many of the nations of Europe with their American dependencies have been involved in a contest unusually bloody exhausting and calamitous in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by domestic convulsion and insurrection in which many of the arts most useful to society have been exposed to discouragement and decay in which scarcity of subsistence has imbittered other sufferings while even the anticipations of a return of the blessings of peace and repose are alloyed by the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens which press upon all the departments of industry and threaten to clog the future springs of government our favored country happy in a striking contrast has enjoyed tranquillity a tranquillity the more satisfactory because maintained at the expense of no duty Faithful to ourselves we have violated no obligation to others Our agriculture commerce and manufactures prosper beyond former example the molestations of our trade to prevent a continuance of which however very pointed remonstrances have been made being overbalanced by the aggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral position Our population advances with a celerity which exceeding the most sanguine calculations proportionally augments our strength and resources and guarantees our future security Every part of the Union displays indications of rapid and various improvement and with burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived with resources fully adequate to our present exigencies with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty and with mild and wholesome laws is it too much to say that our country exhibits a spectacle of national happiness never surpassed if ever before equaled Placed in a situation every way so auspicious motives of commanding force impel us with sincere acknowledgment to Heaven and pure love to our country to unite our efforts to preserve prolong and improve our immense advantages To cooperate with you in this desirable work is a fervent and favorite wish of my heart It is a valuable ingredient in the general estimate of our welfare that the part of our country which was lately the scene of disorder and insurrection now enjoys the blessings of quiet and order The misled have abandoned their errors and pay the respect to our Constitution and laws which is due from good citizens to the public authorities of the society These circumstances have induced me to pardon generally the offenders here referred to and to extend forgiveness to those who had been adjudged to capital punishment For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers with which I am vested yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice dignity and safety may permit Gentlemen Among the objects which will claim your attention in the course of the session a review of our military establishment is not the least important It is called for by the events which have changed and may be expected still further to change the relative situation of our frontiers In this review you will doubtless allow due weight to the considerations that the questions between us and certain foreign powers are not yet finally adjusted that the war in Europe is not yet terminated and that our Western posts when recovered will demand provision for garrisoning and securing them A statement of our present military force will be laid before you by the Department of War With the review of our Army establishment is naturally connected that of the militia It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan further experience may have unfolded The subject is of so much moment in my estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the consideration of it may be renewed until the greatest attainable perfection shall be accomplished Time is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the object while none better deserves the persevering attention of the public councils While we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our Western borders so well authorizes it is necessary that we should not lose sight of an important truth which continually receives new confirmations namely that the provisions heretofore made with a view to the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawless part of our frontier inhabitants are insufficient It is demonstrated that these violences can now be perpetrated with impunity and it can need no argument to prove that unless the murdering of Indians can be restrained by bringing the murderers to condign punishment all the exertions of the Government to prevent destructive retaliations by the Indians will prove fruitless and all our present agreeable prospects illusory The frequent destruction of innocent women and children who are chiefly the victims of retaliation must continue to shock humanity and an enormous expense to drain the Treasury of the Union To enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice it is indispensable that there shall be competent means of rendering justice to them If these means can be devised by the wisdom of Congress and especially if there can be added an adequate provision for supplying the necessities of the Indians on reasonable terms a measure the mention of which I the more readily repeat as in all the conferences with them they urge it with solicitude I should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent I add with pleasure that the probability even of their civilization is not diminished by the experiments which have been thus far made under the auspices of Government The accomplishment of this work if practicable will reflect undecaying luster on our national character and administer the most grateful consolations that virtuous minds can know Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The state of our revenue with the sums which have been borrowed and reimbursed pursuant to different acts of Congress will be submitted from the proper Department together with an estimate of the appropriations necessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year Whether measures may not be advisable to reinforce the provision of the redemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination Congress have demonstrated their sense to be and it were superfluous to repeat mine that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable extinction of our public debt accords as much with the true interest of our country as with the general sense of our constituents Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint will shew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some further legislative provisions for carrying the business of it more completely into effect and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in particular quarters The progress in providing materials for the frigates and in building them the state of the fortifications of our harbors the measures which have been pursued for obtaining proper sites for arsenals and for replenishing our magazines with military stores and the steps which have been taken toward the execution of the law for opening a trade with the Indians will likewise be presented for the information of Congress Temperate discussion of the important subjects which may arise in the course of the session and mutual forbearance where there is a difference of opinion are too obvious and necessary for the peace happiness and welfare of our country to need any recommendation of mine': 1, 'Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives In recurring to the internal situation of our country since I had last the pleasure to address you I find ample reason for a renewed expression of that gratitude to the Ruler of the Universe which a continued series of prosperity has so often and so justly called forth The acts of the last session which required special arrangements have been as far as circumstances would admit carried into operation Measures calculated to insure a continuance of the friendship of the Indians and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier have been digested and adopted In the framing of these care has been taken to guard on the one hand our advanced settlements from the predatory incursions of those unruly individuals who can not be restrained by their tribes and on the other hand to protect the rights secured to the Indians by treaty to draw them nearer to the civilized state and inspire them with correct conceptions of the power as well as justice of the Government The meeting of the deputies from the Creek Nation at Colerain in the State of Georgia which had for a principal object the purchase of a parcel of their land by that State broke up without its being accomplished the nation having previous to their departure instructed them against making any sale The occasion however has been improved to confirm by a new treaty with the Creeks their preexisting engagements with the United States and to obtain their consent to the establishment of trading houses and military posts within their boundary by means of which their friendship and the general peace may be more effectually secured The period during the late session at which the appropriation was passed for carrying into effect the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the United States and His Brittanic Majesty necessarily procrastinated the reception of the posts stipulated to be delivered beyond the date assigned for that event As soon however as the Governor General of Canada could be addressed with propriety on the subject arrangements were cordially and promptly concluded for their evacuation and the United States took possession of the principal of them comprehending Oswego Niagara Detroit Michilimackinac and Fort Miami where such repairs and additions have been ordered to be made as appeared indispensable The commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great Britain to determine which is the river St Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace of agreed in the choice of Egbert Benson esq of New York for the rd commissioner The whole met at St Andrew s in Passamaquoddy Bay in the beginning of October and directed surveys to be made of the rivers in dispute but deeming it impracticable to have these surveys completed before the next year they adjourned to meet at Boston in August for the final decision of the question Other commissioners appointed on the part of the United States agreeably to the th article of the treaty with Great Britain relative to captures and condemnation of vessels and other property met the commissioners of His Britannic Majesty in London in August last when John Trumbull esq was chosen by lot for the th commissioner In October following the board were to proceed to business As yet there has been no communication of commissioners on the part of Great Britain to unite with those who have been appointed on the part of the United States for carrying into effect the th article of the treaty The treaty with Spain required that the commissioners for running the boundary line between the territory of the United States and His Catholic Majesty s provinces of East and West Florida should meet at the Natchez before the expiration of months after the exchange of the ratifications which was effected at Aranjuez on the th day of April and the troops of His Catholic Majesty occupying any posts within the limits of the United States were within the same time period to be withdrawn The commissioner of the United States therefore commenced his journey for the Natchez in September and troops were ordered to occupy the posts from which the Spanish garrisons should be withdrawn Information has been recently received of the appointment of a commissioner on the part of His Catholic Majesty for running the boundary line but none of any appointment for the adjustment of the claims of our citizens whose vessels were captured by the armed vessels of Spain In pursuance of the act of Congress passed in the last session for the protection and relief of American sea men agents were appointed one to reside in Great Britain and the other in the West Indies The effects of the agency in the West Indies are not yet fully ascertained but those which have been communicated afford grounds to believe the measure will be beneficial The agent destined to reside in Great Britain declining to accept the appointment the business has consequently devolved on the minister of the United States in London and will command his attention until a new agent shall be appointed After many delays and disappointments arising out of the European war the final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and Regency of Algiers will in all present appearance be crowned with success but under great though inevitable disadvantages in the pecuniary transactions occasioned by that war which will render further provision necessary The actual liberation of all our citizens who were prisoners in Algiers while it gratifies every feeling of heart is itself an earnest of a satisfactory termination of the whole negotiation Measures are in operation for effecting treaties with the Regencies of Tunis and Tripoli To an active external commerce the protection of a naval force is indispensable This is manifest with regard to wars in which a State is itself a party But besides this it is in our own experience that the most sincere neutrality is not a sufficient guard against the depredations of nations at war To secure respect to a neutral flag requires a naval force organized and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggression This may even prevent the necessity of going to war by discouraging belligerent powers from committing such violations of the rights of the neutral party as may first or last leave no other option From the best information I have been able to obtain it would seem as if our trade to the Mediterranean without a protecting force will always be insecure and our citizens exposed to the calamities from which numbers of them have but just been relieved These considerations invite the United States to look to the means and to set about the gradual creation of a navy The increasing progress of their navigation promises them at no distant period the requisite supply of sea men and their means in other respects favor the undertaking It is an encouragement likewise that their particular situation will give weight and influence to a moderate naval force in their hands Will it not then be advisable to begin without delay to provide and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of ships of war and to proceed in the work by degrees in proportion as our resources shall render it practicable without inconvenience so that a future war of Europe may not find our commerce in the same unprotected state in which it was found by the present Congress have repeatedly and not without success directed their attention to the encouragement of manufactures The object is of too much consequence not to insure a continuance of their efforts in every way which shall appear eligible As a general rule manufactures on public account are inexpedient but where the state of things in a country leaves little hope that certain branches of manufacture will for a great length of time obtain when these are of a nature essential to the furnishing and equipping of the public force in time of war are not establishments for procuring them on public account to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public service recommended by strong considerations of national policy as an exception to the general rule Ought our country to remain in such cases dependent on foreign supply precarious because liable to be interrupted If the necessary article should in this mode cost more in time of peace will not the security and independence thence arising form an ample compensation Establishments of this sort commensurate only with the calls of the public service in time of peace will in time of war easily be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the Government and may even perhaps be made to yield a surplus for the supply of our citizens at large so as to mitigate the privations from the interruption of their trade If adopted the plan ought to exclude all those branches which are already or likely soon to be established in the country in order that there may be no danger of interference with pursuits of individual industry It will not be doubted that with reference either to individual or national welfare agriculture is of primary importance In proportion as nations advance in population and other circumstances of maturity this truth becomes more apparent and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage Institutions for promoting it grow up supported by the public purse and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety Among the means which have been employed to this end none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of boards composed of proper characters charged with collecting and diffusing information and enabled by premiums and small pecuniary aids to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and improvement This species of establishment contributes doubly to the increase of improvement by stimulating to enterprise and experiment and by drawing to a common center the results everywhere of individual skill and observation and spreading them thence over the whole nation Experience accordingly has shewn that they are very cheap instruments of immense national benefits I have heretofore proposed to the consideration of Congress the expediency of establishing a national university and also a military academy The desirableness of both these institutions has so constantly increased with every new view I have taken of the subject that I can not omit the opportunity of once for all recalling your attention to them The assembly to which I address myself is too enlightened not to be fully sensible how much a flourishing state of the arts and sciences contributes to national prosperity and reputation True it is that our country much to its honor contains many seminaries of learning highly repeatable and useful but the funds upon which they rest are too narrow to command the ablest professors in the different departments of liberal knowledge for the institution contemplated though they would be excellent auxiliaries Amongst the motives to such an institution the assimilation of the principles opinions and manners of our country men by the common education of a portion of our youth from every quarter well deserves attention The more homogenous our citizens can be made in these particulars the greater will be our prospect of permanent union and a primary object of such a national institution should be the education of our youth in the science of government In a republic what species of knowledge can be equally important and what duty more pressing on its legislature than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country The institution of a military academy is also recommended by cogent reasons However pacific the general policy of a nation may be it ought never to be without an adequate stock of military knowledge for emergencies The first would impair the energy of its character and both would hazard its safety or expose it to greater evils when war could not be avoided besides that war might often not depend upon its own choice In proportion as the observance of pacific maxims might exempt a nation from the necessity of practicing the rules of the military art ought to be its care in preserving and transmitting by proper establishments the knowledge of that art Whatever argument may be drawn from particular examples superficially viewed a thorough examination of the subject will evince that the art of war is at once comprehensive and complicated that it demands much previous study and that the possession of it in its most improved and perfect state is always of great moment to the security of a nation This therefore ought to be a serious care of every government and for this purpose an academy where a regular course of instruction is given is an obvious expedient which different nations have successfully employed The compensation to the officers of the United States in various instances and in none more than in respect to the most important stations appear to call for legislative revision The consequences of a defective provision are of serious import to the Government If private wealth is to supply the defect of public retribution it will greatly contract the sphere within which the selection of character for office is to be made and will proportionally diminish the probability of a choice of men able as well as upright Besides that it should be repugnant to the vital principles of our Government virtually to exclude from public trusts talents and virtue unless accompanied by wealth While in our external relations some serious inconveniences and embarrassments have been overcome and others lessened it is with much pain and deep regret I mention that circumstances of a very unwelcome nature have lately occurred Our trade has suffered and is suffering extensive injuries in the West Indies from the cruisers and agents of the French Republic and communications have been received from its minister here which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our commerce by its authority and which are in other respects far from agreeable It has been my constant sincere and earnest wish in conformity with that of our nation to maintain cordial harmony and a perfectly friendly understanding with that Republic This wish remains unabated and I shall persevere in the endeavor to fulfill it to the utmost extent of what shall be consistent with a just and indispensable regard to the rights and honor of our country nor will I easily cease to cherish the expectation that a spirit of justice candor and friendship on the part of the Republic will eventually insure success In pursuing this course however I can not forget what is due to the character of our Government and nation or to a full and entire confidence in the good sense patriotism self respect and fortitude of my country men I reserve for a special message a more particular communication on this interesting subject Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I have directed an estimate of the appropriations necessary for the service of the ensuing year to be submitted from the proper Department with a view of the public receipts and expenditures to the latest period to which an account can be prepared It is with satisfaction I am able to inform you that the revenues of the United States continue in a state of progressive improvement A reenforcement of the existing provisions for discharging our public debt was mentioned in my address at the opening of the last session Some preliminary steps were taken toward it the maturing of which will no doubt engage your zealous attention during the present I will only add that it will afford me a heart felt satisfaction to concur in such further measures as will ascertain to our country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the debt Posterity may have cause to regret if from any motive intervals of tranquillity are left unimproved for accelerating this valuable end Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives My solicitude to see the militia of the United States placed on an efficient establishment has been so often and so ardently expressed that I shall but barely recall the subject to your view on the present occasion at the same time that I shall submit to your inquiry whether our harbors are yet sufficiently secured The situation in which I now stand for the last time in the midst of the representatives of the people of the United States naturally recalls the period when the administration of the present form of government commenced and I can not omit the occasion to congratulate you and my country on the success of the experiment nor to repeat my fervent supplications to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe and Sovereign Arbiter of Nations that His providential care may still be extended to the United States that the virtue and happiness of the people may be preserved and that the Government which they have instituted for the protection of their liberties may be perpetual': 1, 'Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary on account of the contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia to convene the National Legislature at some other place This measure it was desirable to avoid because it would occasion much public inconvenience and a considerable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitants of this city whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their fellow citizens Therefore after taking measures to ascertain the state and decline of the sickness I postponed my determination having hopes now happily realized that without hazard to the lives or health of the members Congress might assemble at this place where it was next by law to meet I submit however to your consideration whether a power to postpone the meeting of Congress without passing the time fixed by the Constitution upon such occasions would not be a useful amendment to the law of Although I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in Europe and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of our citizens from injustice and violence at sea we have nevertheless abundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for interior tranquillity and personal security for propitious seasons prosperous agriculture productive fisheries and general improvements and above all for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a calm but steady determination to support our sovereignty as well as our moral and our religious principles against all open and secret attacks Our envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked one in July the other in August to join their colleague in Holland I have received intelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland from whence they all proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days of the th of September Whatever may be the result of this mission I trust that nothing will have been omitted on my part to conduct the negotiation to a successful conclusion on such equitable terms as may be compatible with the safety honor and interest of the United States Nothing in the mean time will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of which on many former occasions the people of the United States have given such memorable proofs and the exertion of those resources for national defense which a beneficent Providence has kindly placed within their power It may be confidently asserted that nothing has occurred since the adjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionary measures recommended by me to the consideration of the two Houses at the opening of your late extraordinary session If that system was then prudent it is more so now as increasing depredations strengthen the reasons for its adoption Indeed whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France and whether the war in Europe is or is not to continue I hold it most certain that permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained The state of society has so long been disturbed the sense of moral and religious obligations so much weakened public faith and national honor have been so impaired respect to treaties has been so diminished and the law of nations has lost so much of its force while pride ambition avarice and violence have been so long unrestrained there remains no reasonable ground on which to raise an expectation that a commerce without protection or defense will not be plundered The commerce of the United States is essential if not to their existence at least to their comfort their growth prosperity and happiness The genius character and habits of the people are highly commercial Their cities have been formed and exist upon commerce Our agriculture fisheries arts and manufactures are connected with and depend upon it In short commerce has made this country what it is and it can not be destroyed or neglected without involving the people in poverty and distress Great numbers are directly and solely supported by navigation The faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of commercial and sea faring no less than of the other citizens Under this view of our affairs I should hold myself guilty of a neglect of duty if I forbore to recommend that we should make every exertion to protect our commerce and to place our country in a suitable posture of defense as the only sure means of preserving both I have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power at the opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeable information of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majesty respecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and the demarcation of the line of limits but by the latest authentic intelligence Spanish garrisons were still continued within our country and the running of the boundary line had not been commenced These circumstances are the more to be regretted as they can not fail to affect the Indians in a manner injurious to the United States Still however indulging the hope that the answers which have been given will remove the objections offered by the Spanish officers to the immediate execution of the treaty I have judged it proper that we should continue in readiness to receive the posts and to run the line of limits Further information on this subject will be communicated in the course of the session In connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western frontier it is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents to alienate the affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to actual hostilities against the United States Great activity has been exerted by those persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian tribes residing within the territory of the United States to influence them to transfer their affections and force to a foreign nation to form them into a confederacy and prepare them for war against the United States Although measures have been taken to counteract these infractions of our rights to prevent Indian hostilities and to preserve entire their attachment to the United States it is my duty to observe that to give a better effect to these measures and to obviate the consequences of a repetition of such practices a law providing adequate punishment for such offenses may be necessary The commissioners appointed under the th article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the United States and Great Britain to ascertain the river which was truly intended under the name of the river St Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace met at Passamaquoddy Bay in October and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question and the adjacent shores and islands and being of opinion that actual surveys of both rivers to their sources were necessary gave to the agents of the two nations instructions for that purpose and adjourned to meet at Boston in August They met but the surveys requiring more time than had been supposed and not being then completed the commissioners again adjourned to meet at Providence in the State of Rhode Island in June next when we may expect a final examination and decision The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the th article of the treaty met at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British subjects for debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due to them from citizens or inhabitants of the United States Various causes have hitherto prevented any determinations but the business is now resumed and doubtless will be prosecuted without interruption Several decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for losses and damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or condemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by the commissioners in London conformably to the th article of the treaty The sums awarded by the commissioners have been paid by the British Government A considerable number of other claims where costs and damages and not captured property were the only objects in question have been decided by arbitration and the sums awarded to the citizens of the United States have also been paid The commissioners appointed agreeably to the st article of our treaty with Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and decide on the claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war between Spain and France Their sittings have been interrupted but are now resumed The United States being obligated to make compensation for the losses and damages sustained by British subjects upon the award of the commissioners acting under the th article of the treaty with Great Britain and for the losses and damages sustained by British subjects by reason of the capture of their vessels and merchandise taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States and brought into their ports or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of the United States upon the awards of the commissioners acting under the th article of the same treaty it is necessary that provision be made for fulfilling these obligations The numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the French Republic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned considerable expenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before their tribunals The sums required for this purpose have in divers instances been disbursed by the consuls of the United States By means of the same captures great numbers of our sea men have been thrown ashore in foreign countries destitute of all means of subsistence and the sick in particular have been exposed to grievous sufferings The consuls have in these cases also advanced moneys for their relief For these advances they reasonably expect reimbursements from the United States The consular act relative to sea men requires revision and amendment The provisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return are found to be inadequate and ineffectual Another provision seems necessary to be added to the consular act Some foreign vessels have been discovered sailing under the flag of the United States and with forged papers It seldom happens that the consuls can detect this deception because they have no authority to demand an inspection of the registers and sea letters Gentlemen of the House of Representatives It is my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those objects which by the Constitution are placed particularly within your sphere the national debts and taxes Since the decay of the feudal system by which the public defense was provided for chiefly at the expense of individuals the system of loans has been introduced and as no nation can raise within the year by taxes sufficient sums for its defense and military operations in time of war the sums loaned and debts contracted have necessarily become the subjects of what have been called funding systems The consequences arising from the continual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonish us to be careful to prevent their growth in our own The national defense must be provided for as well as the support of Government but both should be accomplished as much as possible by immediate taxes and as little as possible by loans The estimates for the service of the ensuing year will by my direction be laid before you Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives We are met together at a most interesting period The situations of the principal powers of Europe are singular and portentous Connected with some by treaties and with all by commerce no important event there can be indifferent to us Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity not less for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor safety and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertions of wisdom and firmness In all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence': 1, 'Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives While with reverence and resignation we contemplate the dispensations of Divine Providence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with which several of our cities and towns have been visited there is cause for gratitude and mutual congratulations that the malady has disappeared and that we are again permitted to assemble in safety at the seat of Government for the discharge of our important duties But when we reflect that this fatal disorder has within a few years made repeated ravages in some of our principal sea ports and with increased malignancy and when we consider the magnitude of the evils arising from the interruption of public and private business whereby the national interests are deeply affected I think it my duty to invite the Legislature of the Union to examine the expediency of establishing suitable regulations in aid of the health laws of the respective States for these being formed on the idea that contagious sickness may be communicated through the channels of commerce there seems to be a necessity that Congress who alone can regulate trade should frame a system which while it may tend to preserve the general health may be compatible with the interests of commerce and the safety of the revenue While we think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate sufferers we have abundant reason to present to the Supreme Being our annual oblations of gratitude for a liberal participation in the ordinary blessings of His providence To the usual subjects of gratitude I can not omit to add one of the first importance to our well being and safety I mean that spirit which has arisen in our country against the menaces and aggression of a foreign nation A manly sense of national honor dignity and independence has appeared which if encouraged and invigorated by every branch of the Government will enable us to view undismayed the enterprises of any foreign power and become the sure foundation of national prosperity and glory The course of the transactions in relation to the United States and France which have come to my knowledge during your recess will be made the subject of a future communication That communication will confirm the ultimate failure of the measures which have been taken by the Government of the United States toward an amicable adjustment of differences with that power You will at the same time perceive that the French Government appears solicitous to impress the opinion that it is averse to a rupture with this country and that it has in a qualified manner declared itself willing to receive a minister from the United States for the purpose of restoring a good understanding It is unfortunate for professions of this kind that they should be expressed in terms which may countenance the inadmissible pretension of a right to prescribe the qualifications which a minister from the United States should possess and that while France is asserting the existence of a disposition on her part to conciliate with sincerity the differences which have arisen the sincerity of a like disposition on the part of the United States of which so many demonstrative proofs have been given should even be indirectly questioned It is also worthy of observation that the decree of the Directory alleged to be intended to restrain the depredations of French cruisers on our commerce has not given and can not give any relief It enjoins them to conform to all the laws of France relative to cruising and prizes while these laws are themselves the sources of the depredations of which we have so long so justly and so fruitlessly complained The law of France enacted in January last which subjects to capture and condemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes if any portion of the latter are of British fabric or produce although the entire property belong to neutrals instead of being rescinded has lately received a confirmation by the failure of a proposition for its repeal While this law which is an unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nations it attacks continues in force those nations can see in the French Government only a power regardless of their essential rights of their independence and sovereignty and if they possess the means they can reconcile nothing with their interest and honor but a firm resistance Hitherto therefore nothing is discoverable in the conduct of France which ought to change or relax our measures of defense On the contrary to extend and invigorate them is our true policy We have no reason to regret that these measures have been thus far adopted and pursued and in proportion as we enlarge our view of the portentous and incalculable situation of Europe we shall discover new and cogent motives for the full development of our energies and resources But in demonstrating by our conduct that we do not fear war in the necessary protection of our rights and honor we shall give no room to infer that we abandon the desire of peace An efficient preparation for war can alone insure peace It is peace that we have uniformly and perseveringly cultivated and harmony between us and France may be restored at her option But to send another minister without more determinate assurances that he would be received would be an act of humiliation to which the United States ought not to submit It must therefore be left with France if she is indeed desirous of accommodation to take the requisite steps The United States will steadily observe the maxims by which they have hitherto been governed They will respect the sacred rights of embassy and with a sincere disposition on the part of France to desist from hostility to make reparation for the injuries heretofore inflicted on our commerce and to do justice in future there will be no obstacle to the restoration of a friendly intercourse In making to you this declaration I give a pledge to France and the world that the Executive authority of this country still adheres to the humane and pacific policy which has invariably governed its proceedings in conformity with the wishes of the other branches of the Government and of the people of the United States But considering the late manifestations of her policy toward foreign nations I deem it a duty deliberately and solemnly to declare my opinion that whether we negotiate with her or not vigorous preparations for war will be alike indispensable These alone will give to us an equal treaty and insure its observance Among the measures of preparation which appear expedient I take the liberty to recall your attention to the naval establishment The beneficial effects of the small naval armament provided under the acts of the last session are known and acknowledged Perhaps no country ever experienced more sudden and remarkable advantages from any measure of policy than we have derived from the arming for our maritime protection and defense We ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for an increase of our Navy to a size sufficient to guard our coast and protect our trade Such a naval force as it is doubtless in the power of the United States to create and maintain would also afford to them the best means of general defense by facilitating the safe transportation of troops and stores to every part of our extensive coast To accomplish this important object a prudent foresight requires that systematic measures be adopted for procuring at all times the requisite timber and other supplies In what manner this shall be done I leave to your consideration I will now advert gentlemen to some matters of less moment but proper to be communicated to the National Legislature After the Spanish garrisons had evacuated the posts they occupied at the Natchez and Walnut Hills the commissioner of the United States commences his observations to ascertain the point near the Mississippi which terminated the northernmost part of the st degree of north latitude From thence he proceeded to run the boundary line between the United States and Spain He was afterwards joined by the Spanish commissioner when the work of the former was confirmed and they proceeded together to the demarcation of the line Recent information renders it probable that the Southern Indians either instigated to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequences of suffering white people to run a line over lands to which the Indian title had not been extinguished have ere this time stopped the progress of the commissioners and considering the mischiefs which may result from continuing the demarcation in opposition to the will of the Indian tribes the great expense attending it and that the boundaries which the commissioners have actually established probably extend at least as far as the Indian title has been extinguished it will perhaps become expedient and necessary to suspend further proceedings by recalling our commissioner The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the th article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the United States and His Britannic Majesty to determine what river was truly intended under the name of the river St Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace and forming a part of the boundary therein described have finally decided that question On the th of October they made their declaration that a river called Scoodiac which falls into Passamaquoddy Bay at its northwestern quarter was the true St Croix intended in the treaty of peace as far as its great fork where one of its streams comes from the westward and the other from the northward and that the latter stream is the continuation of the St Croix to its source This decision it is understood will preclude all contention among the individual claimants as it seems that the Scoodiac and its northern branch bound the grants of land which have been made by the respective adjoining Governments A subordinate question however it has been suggested still remains to be determined Between the mouth of the St Croix as now settled and what is usually called the Bay of Fundy lie a number of valuable islands The commissioners have not continued the boundary line through any channel of these islands and unless the bay of Passamaquoddy be a part of the Bay of Fundy this further adjustment of boundary will be necessary but it is apprehended that this will not be a matter of any difficulty Such progress has been made in the examination and decision of cases of captures and condemnations of American vessels which were the subject of the th article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the United States and Great Britain that it is supposed the commissioners will be able to bring their business to a conclusion in August of the ensuing year The commissioners acting under the th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain have adjusted most of the claims of our citizens for losses sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war between France and Spain Various circumstances have concurred to delay the execution of the law for augmenting the military establishment among these the desire of obtaining the fullest information to direct the best selection of officers As this object will now be speedily accomplished it is expected that the raising and organizing of the troops will proceed without obstacle and with effect Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I have directed an estimate of the appropriations which will be necessary for the service of the ensuing year to be laid before you accompanied with a view of the public receipts and expenditures to a recent period It will afford you satisfaction to infer the great extent and solidity of the public resources from the prosperous state of the finances notwithstanding the unexampled embarrassments which have attended commerce When you reflect on the conspicuous examples of patriotism and liberality which have been exhibited by our mercantile fellow citizens and how great a proportion of the public resources depends on their enterprise you will naturally consider whether their convenience can not be promoted and reconciled with the security of the revenue by a revision of the system by which the collection is at present regulated During your recess measures have been steadily pursued for effecting the valuations and returns directed by the act of the last session preliminary to the assessment and collection of a direct tax No other delays or obstacles have been experienced except such as were expected to arise from the great extent of our country and the magnitude and novelty of the operation and enough has been accomplished to assure a fulfillment of the views of the Legislature Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I can not close this address without once more adverting to our political situation and inculcating the essential importance of uniting in the maintenance of our dearest interests and I trust that by the temper and wisdom of your proceedings and by a harmony of measures we shall secure to our country that weight and respect to which it is so justly entitled': 1, 'Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives It is with peculiar satisfaction that I meet the th Congress of the United States of America Coming from all parts of the Union at this critical and interesting period the members must be fully possessed of the sentiments and wishes of our constituents The flattering prospects of abundance from the labors of the people by land and by sea the prosperity of our extended commerce notwithstanding interruptions occasioned by the belligerent state of a great part of the world the return of health industry and trade to those cities which have lately been afflicted with disease and the various and inestimable advantages civil and religious which secured under our happy frame of government are continued to us unimpaired demand of the whole American people sincere thanks to a benevolent Deity for the merciful dispensations of His providence But while these numerous blessings are recollected it is a painful duty to advert to the ungrateful return which has been made for them by some of the people in certain counties of Pennsylvania where seduced by the arts and misrepresentations of designing men they have openly resisted the law directing the valuation of houses and lands Such defiance was given to the civil authority as rendered hopeless all further attempts by judicial process to enforce the execution of the law and it became necessary to direct a military force to be employed consisting of some companies of regular troops volunteers and militia by whose zeal and activity in cooperation with the judicial power order and submission were restored and many of the offenders arrested Of these some have been convicted of misdemeanors and others charged with various crimes remain to be tried To give due effect to the civil administration of Government and to insure a just execution of the laws a revision and amendment of the judiciary system is indispensably necessary In this extensive country it can not but happen that numerous questions respecting the interpretation of the laws and the rights and duties of officers and citizens must arise On the one hand the laws should be executed on the other individuals should be guarded from oppression Neither of these objects is sufficiently assured under the present organization of the judicial department I therefore earnestly recommend the subject to your serious consideration Persevering in the pacific and humane policy which had been invariably professed and sincerely pursued by the Executive authority of the United States when indications were made on the part of the French Republic of a disposition to accommodate the existing differences between the two countries I felt it to be my duty to prepare for meeting their advances by a nomination of ministers upon certain conditions which the honor of our country dictated and which its moderation had given it a right to prescribe The assurances which were required of the French Government previous to the departure of our envoys have been given through their minister of foreign relations and I have directed them to proceed on their mission to Paris They have full power to conclude a treaty subject to the constitutional advice and consent of the Senate The characters of these gentlemen are sure pledges to their country that nothing incompatible with its honor or interest nothing inconsistent with our obligations of good faith or friendship to any other nation will be stipulated It appearing probable from the information I received that our commercial intercourse with some ports in the island of St Domingo might safely be renewed I took such steps as seemed to me expedient to ascertain that point The result being satisfactory I then in conformity with the act of Congress on the subject directed the restraints and prohibitions of that intercourse to be discontinued on terms which were made known by proclamation Since the renewal of this intercourse our citizens trading to those ports with their property have been duly respected and privateering from those ports has ceased In examining the claims of British subjects by the commissioners at Philadelphia acting under the th article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation with Great Britain a difference of opinion on points deemed essential in the interpretation of that article has arisen between the commissioners appointed by the United States and the other members of that board from which the former have thought it their duty to withdraw It is sincerely to be regretted that the execution of an article produced by a mutual spirit of amity and justice should have been thus unavoidably interrupted It is however confidently expected that the same spirit of amity and the same sense of justice in which it originated will lead to satisfactory explanations In consequence of the obstacles to the progress of the commission in Philadelphia His Britannic Majesty has directed the commissioners appointed by him under the th article of the treaty relating to the British captures of American vessels to withdraw from the board sitting in London but with the express declaration of his determination to fulfill with punctuality and good faith the engagements which His Majesty has contracted by his treaty with the United States and that they will be instructed to resume their functions whenever the obstacles which impede the progress of the commission at Philadelphia shall be removed It being in like manner my sincere determination so far as the same depends on me that with equal punctuality and good faith the engagements contracted by the United States in their treaties with His Britannic Majesty shall be fulfilled I shall immediately instruct our minister at London to endeavor to obtain the explanation necessary to a just performance of those engagements on the part of the United States With such dispositions on both sides I can not entertain a doubt that all difficulties will soon be removed and that the two boards will then proceed and bring the business committed to them respectively to a satisfactory conclusion The act of Congress relative to the seat of the Government of the United States requiring that on the st Monday of December next it should be transferred from Philadelphia to the District chosen for its permanent seat it is proper for me to inform you that the commissioners appointed to provide suitable buildings for the accommodation of Congress and of the President and of the public offices of the Government have made a report of the state of the buildings designed for those purposes in the city of Washington from which they conclude that the removal of the seat of Government to that place at the time required will be practicable and the accommodation satisfactory Their report will be laid before you Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the service of the ensuing year together with an account of the revenue and expenditure to be laid before you During a period in which a great portion of the civilized world has been involved in a war unusually calamitous and destructive it was not to be expected that the United States could be exempted from extraordinary burthens Although the period is not arrived when the measures adopted to secure our country against foreign attacks can be renounced yet it is alike necessary for the honor of the Government and the satisfaction of the community that an exact economy should be maintained I invite you gentlemen to investigate the different branches of the public expenditure The examination will lead to beneficial retrenchments or produce a conviction of the wisdom of the measures to which the expenditure relates Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives At a period like the present when momentous changes are occurring and every hour is preparing new and great events in the political world when a spirit of war is prevalent in almost every nation with whose affairs the interests of the United States have any connection unsafe and precarious would be our situation were we to neglect the means of maintaining our just rights The result of the mission to France is uncertain but however it may terminate a steady perseverance in a system of national defense commensurate with our resources and the situation of our country is an obvious dictate of wisdom for remotely as we are placed from the belligerent nations and desirous as we are by doing justice to all to avoid offense to any nothing short of the power of repelling aggressions will secure to our country a rational prospect of escaping the calamities of war or national degradation As to myself it is my anxious desire so to execute the trust reposed in me as to render the people of the United States prosperous and happy I rely with entire confidence on your cooperation in objects equally your care and that our mutual labors will serve to increase and confirm union among our fellow citizens and an unshaken attachment to our Government': 1, ...})"
