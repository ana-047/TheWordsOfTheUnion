                    On a cold January morning in
                    1790,
                    <b class="pres-name">George Washington</b>
                    stood in front of Congress and
                    delivered the first State of
                    the Union address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the leader of a fledgling
                    nation finding its footing,
                    his precedent has evolved with time,
                    but its essence remains standing to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though <b class="pres-name">Thomas Jefferson</b>
                    elected to send written messages instead of speaking,
                    <b class="pres-name">Woodrow Wilson</b> reinstated
                    the practice of delivering the address in person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1947, <b class="pres-name">Harry Truman</b>
                    delivered the first address to be televised,
                    which has been the preferred medium ever since.

                    State of the Union addresses change depending on
                    the issues facing the nation and the individual speaking.
                </p>

                    However, some speeches are more similar* than others.
                </p>
                <small>
                    *Similarity scores were assigned using <em>cosine similarity</em>,
                    which is an NLP metric to measure the similarity of text.

                <p>
                    For example, addresses given by <b>Democrats</b> in the
                    past 30 years have a high degree of similarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps surprisingly, this similarity also largely
                    extends to speeches given by <b>Republicans</b>*.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This may be due to the tradition of speeches having a
                    formal "Presidential tone" and a refrain of common
                    themes that many presidents tend to address throughout history.

                    On the other hand, different addresses delivered by a President

                <p>
                    Similarly, <b class="pres-name">President Obama's</b> first
