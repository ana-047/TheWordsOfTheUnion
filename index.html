    <!-- Introductory Paragraph -->
    <p>
        The State of the Union (SOTU) address, an annual tradition steeped in history and mandated by the Constitution, emerges as a vital cornerstone of the nation's political discourse. This momentous event sees the President of the United States stepping before the joint session of Congress, delivering a comprehensive overview of the country's current state, outlining policy priorities, and articulating visions for the future. The significance of the SOTU address extends beyond a mere formality; it serves as a critical juncture where leadership meets communication, shaping the trajectory of the nation and reflecting the intricate interplay of policies, public sentiment, and global affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first SOTU address was given by President George Washington in person and over time, it has evolved considerably.
       President Thomas Jefferson abandoned the practice as “monarchical” and time
        consuming, sending written messages instead. This precedent was followed until President
        Woodrow Wilson personally appeared before Congress in 1913. President Franklin Roosevelt
        adopted Wilson’s practice of personal delivery, and it has since become a contemporary tradition.
        With the advent of radio (1923), television (1947), and live webcast (2002) coverage of the
        address, it has gained greater importance by providing a nationwide platform for the President.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we delve into the depths of this unique narrative, Words of the Union invites you to explore the power of words, the evolution of oratory, and the enduring impact of these annual presidential pronouncements on the tapestry of American history. Join us on a journey through time, where every speech is a chapter, and together, we navigate the archives of the State of the Union.

                        addresses are very different from his predecessors...</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Historically, SOTU addresses have varied  depending on
                        the context of the time, the issues facing the nation, and the individual speaking.
                        However, more often than not, there are recurring themes such as the economy, war,
                        foreign policy, trade, healthcare, social security, immigration among others.
                        Presidents also tend to address current events, challenges, and their policy priorities.<br><br>
                        A look at addresses given in the past 30 years in the heatmap below suggests
                        that there is a high degree of
                        similarity between speeches given by the Democratic Presidents. Meanwhile, with the exception of President Trump,
                        there are subtle but not starking differences between Republicans and Democrats as the tone is generally positive and the themes remain constant. Similarity scores were assigned
                        using cosine similarity, which is an NLP metric to measure the similarity of text.
                        The darker shades of blue represent higher similarity scores which lower scores are represented by lighter values.
                        <br><br>
                        President Trump's addresses stand out as being different not only from addresses given by Presidents - Clinton, Obama and Biden
                        but also different from President Bush, a Republican President. The scores highlight not only his eccentric style but also his varying policy priorities.
                        Another interesting observation is the difference in addresses given by President Bush in 2001 after taking office
                        and 2002 in the aftermath of 9/11, which changed the world forever. Also, President Obama's 2009 address after taking office in the middle of the
                        financial crisis is slightly different from his subsequent addresses.
